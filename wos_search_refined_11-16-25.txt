The main focus in combining lidar-radar forest remote sensing has been on the retrieval of the above ground biomass (AGB), which is a primary variable related to carbon cycle in land ecosystems, and has therefore been identified as an essential climate variable. In this review, we summarize the studies combining lidar and radar in estimating forest AGB. We discuss the complementary use of lidar and radar according to the relevance of the added value. The most promising prospects for combining lidar and radar data are in the use of lidar-derived ground elevations for improving large-area biomass estimates from radar, and in upscaling of lidar-based AGB data across large areas covered by spaceborne radar missions.					; Karjalainen, Mika/E-3348-2017; Kankare, Ville/MDS-5312-2025; Vastaranta, Mikko/K-9656-2018	Kankare, Ville/0000-0001-6038-1579; Karjalainen, Mika/0000-0003-4320-8007; Vastaranta, Mikko/0000-0001-6552-9122; Kaasalainen, Sanna/0000-0001-6628-418X														1999-4907				JAN	2015	6	1					252	270		10.3390/f6010252	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f6010252													WOS:000348403700014
J	Ghosh, SM; Behera, MD				Ghosh, Sujit Madhab; Behera, Mukunda Dev			Aboveground biomass estimation using multi-sensor data synergy and machine learning algorithms in a dense tropical forest	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important factor for tracking global carbon cycle to tackle the impact of climate change. Among all available remote sensing data and methods, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in combination with decision tree based machine learning algorithms has produced favourable results in estimating higher biomass values. Suitability of this method for dense tropical forests has not been properly checked with an adequate number of studies. In this study, aboveground biomass was estimated for two major tree species, Shorea robusta, and Tectona grandis, of Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, a tropical forest situated in northern India. Aboveground biomass was estimated by combining C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1A satellite, texture images generated from Sentinel-1A data, vegetation indices produced using Sentinel-2A data and ground inventory plots. Decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were used in place of parametric regression models for establishing a relationship between fields measured values and remotely sensed parameters. Using random forest model with a combination of vegetation indices with SAR backscatter as predictor variables shows the best result for S. robusta forest, with a coefficient of determination value of 0.71 and an RMSE value of 105.027 t/ha. In T. grandis forest best result can be found in the same combination but for stochastic gradient boosted model with a coefficient of determination value of 0.6 and an RMSE value of 79.45 t/ha. This study shows that Sentinel series satellite data has exceptional capabilities in estimating dense forest AGB and machine learning algorithms can be very helpful to do so.					; Ghosh, Sujit/AAA-2727-2021	Ghosh, Sujit/0000-0002-8530-1456; Behera, Mukunda/0000-0002-9976-6270													0143-6228	1873-7730				JUL	2018	96						29	40		10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.05.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.05.011													WOS:000436053300004

Over the past two decades, advancements in remote sensing (RS) technologies, including optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), combined with integrated approaches, have significantly improved AGB estimation accuracy. This systematic review examines spatiotemporal trends in AGB research, evaluates the scale of studies and field plots, and assesses the effectiveness of RS types and their synergies globally. It also addresses uncertainties, prospects, and constraints in RS-based AGB estimation, identifying key research gaps for future investigations. The literature survey reveals a growing use of RS methods and synergies over the last decade. North America and Europe are leading in LiDAR applications, while Asia contributes significantly to optical applications. China and the United States have the highest number of field plots, reflecting extensive sampling efforts and large-scale execution. Research trends focus on temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, with tropical forests exhibiting the highest mean AGB (245 ton ha(-1)). Quantification of data sources shows 30 % of studies used LiDAR, followed by optical (27 %), optical-LiDAR (16 %), SAR-LiDAR (10 %), optical-SAR (7 %), SAR (6 %), and optical-SAR-LiDAR (5 %) combinations. Optical-SAR-LiDAR synergy demonstrated the highest efficiency (R-2 > 0.60), highlighting its potential when integrated with climatic, topographic, and biophysical data using advanced modeling techniques and comprehensive methodologies. This review provides valuable insights for researchers and policymakers focused on carbon cycles, RS, and climate change.

Data saturation and fewer field plots limit the accuracy of AGB estimation. In response to these questions, we constructed a point-line-polygon framework for regional coniferous forests AGB mapping using field survey data, UAV-LiDAR strip data, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imageries in this study. Under this framework, we explored the feasibility of acquiring the LiDAR sampling plots using the LiDAR sampling strategy consistent with the field survey, and analyzed the potentials of multi-scale wavelet transform (WT) textures and tree species stratification for improving AGB estimation accuracy of coniferous forests in North China.ResultsThe results showed that UAV-LiDAR strip data of high density point clouds could be used as a sampling tool to achieve sample amplification. Experimental comparison results showed that the Sentinel-based AGB estimation models incorporating the multi-scale WT textures and SAR data performed better, and the model based on coniferous forests tree species significantly improved the performance of AGB estimation. Additionally, the accuracy comparison using different validation sets indicated that the proposed LiDAR sampling strategy under the point-line-polygon framework was suitable for estimating coniferous forests AGB on a large area. The highest accuracy of AGB estimation of larch, Chinese pine and all coniferous forests was 74.55%, 78.96%, and 73.42%, respectively.ConclusionsThe proposed approach can successfully alleviate the data signal saturation issue and accurately produce a large-scale wall-to-wall high-resolution AGB map by integrating optical and SAR data with a relative small number of field plots.

However, collecting wall-towall laser altimetry data at regional and global scales is cost prohibitive. As a result, studies employing lidar for large area estimation typically collect data via strip sampling, leaving large swaths of the forest unmeasured by the instrument. The goal of this research was to develop and examine the performance of a coregionalization modeling approach for combining field measurements, strip samples of airborne lidar and Landsat-based remote sensing products to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) in interior Alaska's Tanana Valley. The proposed modeling strategy facilitates mapping of AGB density across the domain. Additionally, the coregionalization framework allows for estimation of total AGB for arbitrary areal units within the study area a key advance to support diverse management objectives in interior Alaska. This research focuses on characterization of prediction uncertainty in the form of posterior predictive coverage intervals and standard deviations. Using the framework detailed here, it is possible to quantify estimation uncertainty for any spatial extent, ranging from point level predictions of AGB density to estimates of AGB stocks for the full domain. The lidar-informed coregionalization models consistently outperformed their counterpart lidar-free models in terms of point-level predictive performance and total (mean) AGB precision. Additionally, including a Landsat-derived forest cover covariate further improved precision in regions with lower lidar sampling intensity. Findings also demonstrate that model-based approaches not explicitly accounting for residual spatial dependence can grossly underestimate uncertainty, resulting in falsely precise estimates of AGB. The inferential capabilities of AGB posterior predictive distribution (PPD) products extend beyond simply mapping AGB density. We show how PPD products can provide insight regarding drivers of AGB heterogeneity in boreal forests, including permafrost and fire, highlighting the range of potential applications for Bayesian geostatistical methods to integrate field, airborne and satellite data.					; Ene, Liviu/J-4143-2019; Cook, Bruce/M-4828-2013; Pattison, Robert/KFQ-2053-2024; Morton, Douglas/D-5044-2012	Babcock, Chad/0000-0001-9597-4462; Gobakken, Terje/0000-0001-5534-049X; Finley, Anew/0000-0002-2277-2912; Næsset, Erik/0000-0002-2460-5843; Ene, Liviu Theodor/0000-0003-2572-6169; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				JUN	2018	212						212	230		10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.044													WOS:000435053200017

We studied the estimation of biomass using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data in moist temperate forests in the Galies region of Abbottabad Pakistan. Above-ground biomass (AGB), estimated from 60 field plots, was correlated with vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 image-to-map AGB using regression models. Furthermore, additional explanatory variables were also associated with AGB in the geo-statistical technique, and kriging interpolation was used to predict AGB. The results illustrate that the atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) is the best index (R-2 = 0.67) for estimating AGB. In spectral reflectance, Band 1(Coastal Aerosol 443 nm) performs better than other bands. Multiple linear regression models calibrated with ARVI, NNIR and NDVI yielded better results (R-2 = 0.46) with the lowest RMSE (48.53) and MAE (38.42) and were therefore considered better for biomass estimation. On the other hand, in the geo-statistical technique, distance to settlements, ARVI and annual precipitation were significantly correlated with biomass compared to others. In the stepwise regression method, the forward selection resulted in a very significant value (less than 0.000) for ARVI. Therefore, it can be considered best for prediction and used to interpolate AGB through kriging. Compared to the geo-statistical technique, the remote sensing-based models performed relatively well. Regarding potential sites for REDD+ implementation, temporal analysis of Landsat images showed a decrease in forest area from 8896.23 ha in 1988 to 7692.03 ha in 2018. Therefore, this study concludes that the state-of-the-art open-source sensor, the Sentinel-2 data, has significant potential for forest biomass and carbon stock estimation and can be used for robust regional AGB estimation with acceptable accuracy and frequent availability.

Therefore, it is essential to develop a credible way to estimate forest biomass as carbon stock. Our study used PALSAR-2 (ALOS-2) and Sentinel-2 images to drive the Random Forest regression model, which we trained with airborne lidar data. We used the model to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) of two significant coniferous trees, Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress, in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. We used 48 variables derived from the two remote sensing datasets to predict forest AGB under the Random Forest algorithm, and found that the model that combined the two datasets performed better than models based on only one dataset, with R-2 = 0.31, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 54.38 Mg ha(-1), mean absolute error (MAE) = 40.98 Mg ha(-1), and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 0.35 for Japanese cedar, and R-2 = 0.37, RMSE = 98.63 Mg ha(-1), MAE = 76.97 Mg ha(-1), and rRMSE of 0.33 for Japanese cypress, over the whole AGB range. In the satellite AGB map, the total AGB of Japanese cedar in 17 targeted cities in Ibaraki Prefecture was 5.27 Pg, with a mean of 146.50 Mg ha(-1) and a standard deviation of 44.37 Mg ha(-1). The total AGB of Japanese cypress was 3.56 Pg, with a mean of 293.12 Mg ha(-1) and a standard deviation of 78.48 Mg ha(-1). We also found a strong linear relationship with between the model estimates and Japanese government data, with R-2 = 0.99 for both species and found the government information underestimates the AGB for cypress but overestimates it for cedar. Our results reveal that combining information from multiple sensors can predict forest AGB with increased accuracy and robustness.

A method used to create such inventories is the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm, which spatially extends information from forest inventory (FI) plots to the entire forest land base using wall-to-wall features typically derived from Landsat data. However, the benefits of integrating L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, strongly correlated to forest biomass, have not been assessed for Canadian northern boreal forests. Here we describe an optimized multivariate k-NN implementation of a 151,700 km(2) area in southern NWT that included ca. 2007 Landsat and dual-polarized Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data on board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Five forest attributes were mapped at 30 m cells: stand height, crown closure, stand/total volume and aboveground biomass (AGB). We assessed accuracy gains compared to Landsat-based maps. To circumvent the scarcity of FI plots, we used 3600 footprints from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) as surrogate FI plots, where forest attributes were estimated using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) metrics as predictors. After optimization, k-NN predicted forest attribute values for each pixel as the average of the 4 nearest (k = 4) surrogate FI plots within the Euclidian space of 9 best features (selected among 6 PALSAR, 10 Landsat, and 6 environmental features). Accuracy comparisons were based on 31 National Forest Inventory ground plots and over 1 million airborne LiDAR plots. Maps that included PALSAR HV backscatter resulted in forest attribute predictions with higher goodness of fit (adj. R-2), lower percent mean error (ME%), and percent root mean square error (RMSE%), and lower underestimation for larger attribute values. Predictions were most accurate for conifer stand height (RMSE% = 32.1%, adj. R-2 = 0.58) and AGB (RMSE% = 47.8%, adj. R-2 = 0.74), which is much more abundant in the area than mixedwood or broadleaf. Our study demonstrates that optimizing k-NN parameters and feature space, including PALSAR, Landsat, and environmental variables, is a viable approach for inventory mapping of the northern boreal forest regions of Canada.

The selection of appropriate variables from satellite information and physical variables is important for precise AGB prediction mapping. Because of the complex relationships for AGB prediction, non-parametric machine-learning techniques represent potentially useful techniques for AGB estimation, but their use and comparison in forest remote-sensing applications is still relatively limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of automatic learning techniques, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF), to predict the observed AGB (from 318 permanent sampling plots) from the Landsat 8 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor, spectral indexes, texture indexes and physical variables the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. The result showed that the best SVR model explained 80% of the total variance (root mean square error (RMSE) = 8.20 Mg ha(-1)). The variables that best predicted AGB, in order of importance, were the bands that belong to the region of red and near and middle infrared, and the average temperature. The results show that the SVR technique has a good potential for the estimation of the AGB and that the selection of the model hyperparameters has important implications for optimizing the goodness of fit.					; López-Sánchez, Carlos/K-6486-2016; López-Sánchez, Carlos A/K-6486-2016	Cárdenas-Domínguez, José Luis/0000-0002-4051-7843; López Serrano, Pablito Marcelo/0000-0003-0640-0606; Vega-Nieva, Daniel Jose/0000-0002-1463-6523; Corral, Javier/0000-0002-2851-7517; López-Sánchez, Carlos A/0000-0002-5135-5739														1999-4907				JAN	2020	11	1							11	10.3390/f11010011	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11010011													WOS:000513184500011

The aim of this research is to assess changes in AGB and evaluate the effectiveness of restoration efforts in the North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF), one of the largest remaining peat swamp forests in Peninsular Malaysia, using advanced remote sensing techniques. A Random Forest machine learning method was employed to upscale AGB estimates, derived from a 'LiDAR AGB model', to larger landscape-scale areas with Sentinel-2 spectral and textural variables. The time period under investigation (2015-2018) marked a concentrated phase of restoration and regeneration efforts in NSPSF. The results demonstrate an overall increase in tropical peat swamp AGB during these years, where the total amount of estimated AGB stored in NSPSF increased from 19.3 Tg in 2015 to an estimated 19.8 Tg in 2018. The research found that a tailored variable selection approach improved predictions of AGB, with optimised input variables (n = 62) and parameter adjustments producing a good plausible result (R-2 = 0.80; RMSE = 55.2 Mg/ha). This paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of long-term studies (>5 years) for analyzing the success of tropical peat swamp restoration methods, with a potential for integrating remote sensing technology.

In previous studies, AGB has been estimated using various prediction methods and types of remote sensing data. Increasingly, there is a trend towards integrating various data sources such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and optical data. In this study, we constructed and compared the accuracies of five models for estimating AGB of forests in the upper Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. The five models were constructed using field and remotely-sensed data (optical and LiDAR) and algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Models based on the RF algorithm emerged as being the best among the five algorithms irrespective of the datasets used. The Random Forest AGB model, using only LiDAR data (R-2 = 0.899, RMSE -14.0 t/ha) as the input data, was more effective than the one using optical data (R-2 = 0.835, RMSE = 22.724 t/ha). Compared to LiDAR or optical data alone, the AGB model (R-2 = 0.913, RMSE = 13.352 t/ha) that used the RF algorithm and integrated LiDAR and optical data was found to be optimal. Incorporation of terrain variables with optical data resulted in only slight improvements in accuracy. The models developed in this study could be useful for using integrated airborne LiDAR and passive optical data to accurately estimate forest biomass.

Conventional studies have related the plot-measured or LiDAR-based biomass to remote sensing data using pixel-based approaches. The object-based relationship between AGB and multi-source data from LiDAR, multi-frequency radar, and optical sensors were insufficiently studied. It deserves the further exploration that maps forest AGB using the object-based approach and combines LiDAR data with multi-sensor images, which has the smaller uncertainty of positional discrepancy and local heterogeneity, in heterogeneous mountainous regions. To address the improvement of mapping accuracy, satellite LiDAR data from GEDI and ICEsat-2, and images of ALOS-2 yearly mosaic L band SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-1 C band SAR, Sentinel-2 MSI, and ALOS-1 DSM were combined for pixel- and object-based forest AGB mapping in a vital heterogeneous mountainous forest. For the object-based approach, optimized objects during a multiresolution segmentation were acquired by the ESP (Estimation of the Scale Parameter) tool, and suitable predictors were selected using an algorithm named VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forests). The LiDAR variables at the footprint-level were extracted to connect field plots to the multi-sensor objects as a linear bridge. It was shown that forests' AGB values varied by elevations with a mean value of 142.58 Mg/ha, ranging from 12.61 to 514.28 Mg/ha. The north slope with the lowest elevation (<1100 m) had the largest mean AGB, while the smallest mean AGB was located in the south slope with the altitude above 2000 m. Using independent validation samples, it was indicated by the accuracy comparison that the object-based approach performed better on the precision with relative improvement based on root-mean-square errors (RIRMSE) of 4.46%. The object-based approach also selected more optimized predictors and markedly decreased the prediction time than the pixel-based analysis. Canopy cover and height explained forest AGB with their effects on biomass varying according to the elevation. The elevation from DSM and variables involved in red-edge bands from MSI were the most contributive predictors in heterogeneous temperate forests. This study is a pioneering exploration of object-based AGB mapping by combining satellite data from LiDAR, MSI, and SAR, which offers an improved methodology for regional carbon mapping in the heterogeneous mountainous forests.					; Zhang, Baiyan/MTB-8278-2025; Man, Weidong/HMP-1904-2023; Chen, Lin/JGM-8913-2023; Liu, Mingyue/JPL-7029-2023	Liu, Mingyue/0000-0002-0503-3544; Man, Weidong/0000-0003-1960-1976														2072-4292				JUN	2022	14	12							2743	10.3390/rs14122743	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14122743													WOS:000816680200001

Estimating aboveground biomass in interior Alaska with Landsat data and field measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Terrestrial plant biomass is a key biophysical parameter required for understanding ecological systems in Alaska. An accurate estimation of biomass at a regional scale provides an important data input for ecological modeling in this region. In this study, we created an aboveground biomass (AGB) map at 30-m resolution for the Yukon Flats ecoregion of interior Alaska using Landsat data and field measurements. Tree, shrub, and herbaceous AGB data in both live and dead forms were collected in summers and autumns of 2009 and 2010. Using the Landsat-derived spectral variables and the field AGB data, we generated a regression model and applied this model to map AGB for the ecoregion. A 3-fold cross-validation indicated that the AGB estimates had a mean absolute error of 21.8 Mg/ha and a mean bias error of 5.2 Mg/ha. Additionally, we validated the mapping results using an airborne lidar dataset acquired for a portion of the ecoregion. We found a significant relationship between the lidar-derived canopy height and the Landsat-derived AGB (R-2 = 0.40). The AGB map showed that 90% of the ecoregion had AGB values ranging from 10 Mg/ha to 134 Mg/ha. Vegetation types and fires were the primary factors controlling the spatial AGB patterns in this ecoregion.

Field-based measurements of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) can be costly and difficult to conduct. Multi-source remote sensing data offers the potential to improve the accuracy of modelled AGB predictions. Here, four machine learning methods: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Minimum Distance (MD) were used to construct forest AGB models of Taiyue Mountain forest, Shanxi Province, China using single and multi-sourced remote sensing data and the Google Earth Engine platform. Results showed that the machine learning method that most accurately predicted AGB were GBDT and spectral index for coniferous (R-2 = 0.99; RMSE = 65.52 Mg/ha), broadleaved (R-2 = 0.97; RMSE = 29.14 Mg/ha), and mixed-species (R-2 = 0.97; RMSE = 81.12 Mg/ha) forest types. Models constructed using bivariate variable combinations that included the spectral index improved the AGB estimation accuracy of mixed-species (R-2 = 0.99; RMSE = 59.52 Mg/ha) forest types and reduced slightly the accuracy of coniferous (R-2 = 0.99; RMSE = 101.46 Mg/ha) and broadleaved (R-2 = 0.97; RMSE = 37.59 Mg/ha) forest AGB estimation. Overall, parameterizing machine learning algorithms with multi-source remote sensing variables can improve the prediction accuracy of mixed-species forests.

However, combining the advantages of active and passive data sources to improve estimation accuracy remains challenging. Here, we proposed a new approach for forest AGB modeling based on allometric relationships and using the form of power-law to integrate structural and spectral information. Over 60 km2 of drone light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and 1,370 field plot measurements, covering the four major forest types of China (coniferous forest, sub-tropical broadleaf forest, coniferous and broadleaf-leaved mixed forest, and tropical broadleaf forest), were collected together with Sentinel-2 images to evaluate the proposed approach. The results show that the most universally useful structural and spectral metrics are the average values of canopy height and spectral index rather than their maximum values. Compared with structural attributes used alone, combining structural and spectral information can improve the estimation accuracy of AGB, increasing R2 by about 10% and reducing the root mean square error by about 22%; the accuracy of the proposed approach can yield a R2 of 0.7 in different forests types. The proposed approach performs the best in coniferous forest, followed by sub-tropical broadleaf forest, coniferous and broadleaf-leaved mixed forest, and then tropical broadleaf forest. Furthermore, the simple linear regression used in the proposed method is less sensitive to sample size and outperforms statistically multivariate machine learning-based regression models such as stepwise multiple regression, artificial neural networks, and Random Forest. The proposed approach may provide an alternative solution to map large-scale forest biomass using space-borne LiDAR and optical images with high accuracy.					; Su, Yanjun/F-6719-2019; Hu, Tianyu/KCL-0635-2024; Guo, Qinghua/B-7731-2012; liu, xq/JDW-2596-2023; Guo, Qinghua/B-7731-2012; yang, qiuli/OQK-2771-2025	Kelly, Nina Maggi/0000-0002-0198-2822; Guo, Qinghua/0000-0002-1065-0838; Guo, Qinghua/0000-0002-1065-0838; LIU, ZHONGHUA/0009-0001-0313-2506; 													2095-6355	2197-5620					2022	9								100059	10.1016/j.fecs.2022.100059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fecs.2022.100059													WOS:000843257400001

However, the estimation accuracy of forest AGB is often constrained by scarce in situ measurements and the limitations of using a single data source or retrieval model. This study proposes a multi-source data integration framework using Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data along with eight predictive models (i.e., multiple linear regression-MLR; Elastic-Net; support vector regression (with a linear kernel and polynomial kernel); k-nearest neighbor; back-propagation neural network-BPNN; random forest-RF; and gradient-boosting tree-GBT). With airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived AGB as a reference, a three-stage optimization strategy was developed, including stepwise feature selection (SFS), hyperparameter optimization, and multi-decision vector fusion (MDVF) model construction. Initially, the optimal feature subsets for each model were identified using SFS, followed by hyperparameter optimization through a grid search strategy. Finally, eight models were evaluated, and MDVF was implemented to integrate outputs from the top-performing models. The results revealed that LiDAR-derived AGB demonstrated a strong performance (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 20.27 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 15.90%), validating its effectiveness as a supplement to field measurements, particularly in subtropical forests where traditional inventories are challenging. SFS could adaptively select optimal variable subsets for different models, effectively alleviating multicollinearity. Satellite-based AGB estimation using the MDVF model yielded robust results (R2 = 0.652, RMSE = 31.063 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 20.4%) through the synergy of S-1 and S-2, with R2 increasing by 4.18-7.41% and the RMSE decreasing by 3.55-5.89% compared to the four top-performing models (BPNN, GBT, RF, MLR) in the second optimization stage. This study aims to provide a cost-effective and precise strategy for large-scale and spatially continuous forest AGB mapping, demonstrating the potential of integrating active and passive satellite imagery with airborne LiDAR to enhance AGB mapping accuracy and support further ecological monitoring and forest carbon accounting.

With the growing availability of multi-modal satellite remote sensing (SRS) datasets, their usability towards forest structure estimation is increasing. We assessed the relationship of PlanetScope-, Sentinel-2-, and Landsat-7-derived vegetation indices (VIs), as well as ALOS-2 PALSAR-2- and Sentinel-1-derived backscatter intensities with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and conventionally measured forest structure parameters acquired from 25 field plots in a tropical montane cloud forest in Kafa, Ethiopia. Results showed that canopy gap-related forest structure parameters had their highest correlation (|r| = 0.4 - 0.48) with optical sensor-derived VIs, while vegetation volume-related parameters were mainly correlated with red-edge- and short-wave infrared band-derived VIs (i.e., inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI), normalized difference moisture index), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatters (|r| = -0.57 - 0.49). Using stepwise multi-linear regression with the Akaike information criterion as evaluation parameter, we found that the fusion of different SRS-derived variables can improve the estimation of field-measured structural parameters. The combination of Sentinel-2 VIs and SAR backscatters was dominant in most of the predictive models, while IRECI was found to be the most common predictor for field-measured variables. The statistically significant regression models were able to estimate cumulative plant area volume density with an R-2 of 0.58 and with the lowest relative root mean square error (RRMSE) value (0.23). Mean gap and number of gaps were also significantly estimated, but with higher RRMSE (R-2 = 0.52, RRMSE = 1.4, R-2 = 0.68, and RRMSE = 0.58, respectively). The models showed poor performance in predicting tree density and number of tree species (R-2 = 0.28, RRMSE = 0.41, and R-2 = 0.21, RRMSE = 0.39, respectively). This exploratory study demonstrated that SRS variables are sensitive to retrieve structural differences of tropical forests and have the potential to be used to upscale biodiversity relevant field-based forest structure estimates.

Integrating multi-sensor remote sensing data can improve forest monitoring and evaluation. This study adopted a one-hectare plot size sampling design to improve the integration of GEDI footprints with in-situ, optical, and SAR data for the estimation of forest above-ground biomass (AGB). The study was carried out for a managed tropical forest in the Himalayan foothills of India. The space-borne GEDI retrieved the canopy height of the study area with an RMSE of 3.36 m and Adj. R2 of 0.70. Extrapolating GEDI footprint heights (RH95) with Landsat 8 indices using Random Forest (RF) yielded a spatial canopy height of the study area with an R2 of 0.97 and RMSE of 2.32 m. Using the GEDI canopy height, foliage density, and plant area index, the AGB at GEDI footprints level was estimated using RF, with an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 20.10 Mg ha-1. The spatial AGB model that only considered ALOS-2 SAR variables had an R2 of 0.61 and an RMSE of 18.27 Mg ha-1, whereas the RF model that considered both SAR variables and canopy height had a superior R2 of 0.77 and a lower RMSE of 13.86 Mg ha-1. The addition of canopy height data reduced the RMSE of the AGB model by 4.41 Mg ha-1 and also predicted a higher range of AGB. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining GEDI data with other sensors (optical and SAR data) to provide precise AGB of multistage managed forests using a onehectare plot size sampling design.

This study aims to further explore their capabilities in temperate forest above ground biomass (AGB) estimation by emphasizing the spatial auto-correlation of variables obtained from these two remote sensing tools, which is a usually overlooked aspect in remote sensing applications to vegetation studies. Remote sensing variables including airborne LiDAR metrics, backscattering coefficient for different SAR polarizations and their ratio variables for Radarsat-2 imagery were calculated. First, simple linear regression models (SLR) was established between the field-estimated above ground biomass and the remote sensing variables. Pearson's correlation coefficient (R-2) was used to find which LiDAR metric showed the most significant correlation with the regression residuals and could be selected as co-variable in regression co-kriging (RCoKrig). Second, regression co-kriging was conducted by choosing the regression residuals as dependent variable and the LiDAR metric (Hmean) with highest R-2 as co-variable. Third, above ground biomass over the study area was estimated using SLR model and RCoKrig model, respectively. The results for these two models were validated using the same ground points. Results showed that both of these two methods achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy, while regression co-kriging showed the lower estimation error. It is proved that regression co-kriging model is feasible and effective in mapping the spatial pattern of AGB in the temperate forest using Radarsat-2 data calibrated by airborne LiDAR metrics.

Scaled biomass estimation in woodland ecosystems: Testing the individual and combined capacities of satellite multispectral and lidar data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data enable accurate modeling and mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB), but the limited spatial and temporal extents of ALS data collection limit the capacity for broad-scale carbon accounting. Conversely, while space-based remote sensing instruments provide increased spatial and temporal coverage, it can be difficult to directly link field-level vegetation biometrics to satellite data due to coarser spatial resolution and positional uncertainty. The combined use of ALS and satellite remote sensing data may offer a solution to efficient, accurate, and consistent AGB mapping across time and space. Such airborne-spaceborne data fusion has been demonstrated successfully in high-biomass settings; however, the unique structural conditions of dryland woodland ecosystems, with open canopies and low leaf area indices, pose mapping challenges that require further study. These challenges are particularly acute with large footprint spaceborne lidar, where short, widely-spaced trees may limit the capacity for accurate AGB estimation. In this study, we present a scaled methodological framework for linking field-measured woodland AGB to ALS data and, in turn, linking ALSmodeled AGB to satellite data, using pin similar to on-juniper woodlands in southeastern Utah as a case study. We compare the effectiveness of this scaling approach using two satellite sensors, Landsat 8 OLI (multispectral) and GEDI (lidar). Since the predicted outputs of our local-scale model are being used as inputs to our regional-scale model, we also demonstrate an approach for propagating uncertainty throughout this nested, multiscale analytical framework, leveraging the inherent variability within a random forest's decision trees. Given the positional uncertainty of GEDI footprints, we test a range of different footprint sizes for their relative effects on ALS-GEDI AGB model accuracy. Our local-scale (field-ALS) predictive model was able to account for 74% of variance in AGB, and estimate AGB with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 14 Mg/ha, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 11.09 Mg/ha. Our regional-scale (ALS-Landsat/GEDI) analysis with propagated uncertainty revealed that the combined use of Landsat and GEDI metrics produced the best predictive model (R2 = 0.68; RMSE = 12.71 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.40 Mg/ha), followed by Landsat-only metrics (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 13.08 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.71 Mg/ha), and GEDI-only metrics (R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 16.01 Mg/ha; MAE = 12.14 Mg/ha). These results suggest that Landsat may be better-suited than GEDI for estimating AGB in woodland environments where low canopy covers and short trees limit the capacity for precisely characterizing vegetation structure within largefootprint, waveform lidar data. The footprint size analysis revealed that larger simulated footprints (e.g., 30 m radius and greater) produced higher GEDI model accuracies; however, increasing footprint radii beyond 30 m does not significantly increase model accuracy. This research represents an important step forward in improving our capacity for reliably mapping woodland AGB, and provides an early test case for the application of GEDI data to woodland AGB mapping.

The uncertainty of biomass estimates from LiDAR and SAR across a boreal forest structure gradient	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In this study, we examined the uncertainty of aboveground live biomass (AGB) estimates based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements distributed across a low-biomass vegetation structure gradient from forest to non-forest in boreal-like ecosystems. The conifer-dominant structure gradient was compiled from ground data amassed from multiple field expeditions in central Maine (USA), Aurskog (Norway), and across central Siberia (Russia). Single variable empirical models were built to model AGB from remote sensing metrics. Using these models, we calculated a root mean square error (RMSE) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the RMSE from the difference between the remote sensing AGB predictions and the ground reference AGB estimates within AGB intervals across a 0-100 Mg ha(-1) boreal forest structure gradient. The results show that the error in AGB predictions (RMSE) and the error uncertainty (the CI) from LiDAR and SAR change across a forest gradient. The errors of airborne LiDAR and SAR metrics and spaceborne LiDAR platforms show a general trend of reduced relative errors as AGB magnitudes increase, particularly from 0 to 60 Mg ha(-1). Empirical models relating spaceborne metrics to AGB and estimates of spaceborne LiDAR error uncertainty demonstrate the difficulty of characterizing differences in AGB at the site-level with current spaceborne sensors, particularly below 80 Mg ha(-1) with less than 50-100% error.

These regions are representative of numerous forest biomes and biomass levels globally, from South African woodlands and savannas to the humid tropical forest of Kalimantan. AGB retrieval in each region relied on different sources of reference data, including forest inventory plot data and airborne LiDAR observations, and used a range of retrieval algorithms. This is the widest inter-comparison of regional-to-national AGB maps to date in terms of area, forest types, input datasets, and retrieval methods. The accuracy assessment of all regional maps using independent field data or LiDAR AGB maps resulted in an overall root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 10 t ha(-1) to 55 t ha(-1) (37% to 67% relative RMSE), and an overall bias ranging from -1 t ha(-1) to +5 t ha(-1) at pixel level. The regional maps showed better agreement with field data than previously developed and widely used pan-tropical or northern hemisphere datasets. The comparison of accuracy assessments showed commonalities in error structures despite the variety of methods, input data, and forest biomes. All regional retrievals resulted in overestimation (up to 63 t ha(-1)) in the lower AGB classes, and underestimation (up to 85 t ha(-1)) in the higher AGB classes. Parametric model-based algorithms present advantages due to their low demand on in situ data compared to non-parametric algorithms, but there is a need for datasets and retrieval methods that can overcome the biases at both ends of the AGB range. The outcomes of this study should be considered when developing algorithms to estimate forest biomass at continental to global scale level.

Traditional methods of aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation via Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots lack sufficient sampling intensity to directly produce accurate estimates at fine granularities. Increasing the sampling intensity with additional FIA plots would be labor and time intensive, particularly for large-scale carbon studies. Utilizing remote sensing (RS) data, such as Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), aerial imagery, and satellite images can significantly enhance the efficiency of forest carbon monitoring efforts. The principal objective of this study is to utilize the random forest (RF) algorithm to build predictive AGB models. We utilized 67 explanatory variables, which were extracted from three RS sources resulting in nine RF models. Each RF model was subjected to variable selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The optimum model considered 28 explanatory variables, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 27.19 Mgha-1 and R2 of 0.41. Combining LiDAR with image metrics increased the accuracy of prediction models, serving as a pivotal tool for large area biomass mapping and carbon related decision making.					witharana, chandi/C-9074-2015														2045-2322					AUG 24	2025	15	1							31120	10.1038/s41598-025-15585-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-15585-6								40850968					WOS:001556314600015

Accurate estimations of global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) can improve the understanding of global carbon dynamics and help to quantify anthropogenic carbon emissions. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques have been proven that can accurately capture both horizontal and vertical forest structures and increase the accuracy of forest AGB estimation. In this study, we mapped the global forest AGB density at a 1-km resolution through the integration of ground inventory data, optical imagery, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System/Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite data, climate surfaces, and topographic data. Over 4000 ground inventory records were collected from published literatures to train the forest AGB estimation model and validate the resulting global forest AGB product. Our wall-to-wall global forest AGB map showed that the global forest AGB density was 210.09 Mg/ha on average, with a standard deviation of 109.31 Mg/ha. At the continental level, Africa (333.34 +/- 63.80 Mg/ha) and South America (301.68 +/- 67.43 Mg/ha) had higher AGB density. The AGB density in Asia, North America and Europe were 172.28 +/- 94.75, 166.48 +/- 84.97, and 132.97 +/- 50.70 Mg/ha, respectively. The wall-to-wall forest AGB map was evaluated at plot level using independent plot measurements. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between our predicted results and the validation plots were 0.56 and 87.53 Mg/ha, respectively. At the ecological zone level, the R-2 and RMSE between our map and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested values were 0.56 and 101.21 Mg/ha, respectively. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison was also conducted between our forest AGB map and other published regional AGB products. Overall, our forest AGB map showed good agreements with these regional AGB products, but some of the regional AGB products tended to underestimate forest AGB density.

This study served to develop a methodology for utilizing ICESat-2 data over vegetated areas. The specific objectives were to: (1) derive a simulated ICESat-2 photon-counting lidar (PCL) vegetation product using airborne lidar data, (2) examine the use of simulated PCL metrics for modelling aboveground biomass (AGB) along ICESat-2 profiles using a simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product and reference AGB estimated from airborne lidar data, and (3) estimate forest canopy cover using simulated PCL canopy product data and airborne lidar-derived canopy cover. Using existing airborne lidar data for Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in Texas and known ICESat-2 track locations, PCL simulations were carried out. Three scenarios were analyzed in this study; 1) simulated data without the addition of noise, 2) processed simulated data for daytime, and 3) nighttime scenarios. Segments measuring 100 m along the proposed ICESat-2 tracks were used to extract simulated PCL metrics from each of the three data scenarios and spatially coincident, reference airborne lidar-estimated AGB and airborne lidar canopy cover estimates. Linear regression models were then developed with a subset of the simulated PCL segments to estimate AGB and canopy cover and their performance assessed using separate testing sets. AGB model testing with the simulated dataset without noise, nighttime and daytime scenarios resulted in R-2 values of 0.79, 0.79 and 0.63 respectively, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 19.16 Mg/ha, 19.23 Mg/ha, and 25.35 Mg/ha. Predictive models for canopy cover (4.6 m) achieved R-2 values of 0.93, 0.75 and 0.63 and RMSE values of 6.36%, 12.33% and 15.01% for the simulated dataset without noise, nighttime and daytime scenarios respectively. Findings from this study suggest the potential of ICESat-2 for estimating AGB, given the photon detection rate and background noise anticipated by ICESat-2 under temperate forest settings, and especially in the data format provided by standard ICESat-2 data vegetation products.					; Popescu, Sorin/D-5981-2015; Zhou, Tan/U-3953-2019; Narine, Lana/AAM-5684-2020; Srinivasan, Shruthi/AAY-3388-2020	Neuenschwander, Amy/0000-0001-8184-5707; Narine, Lana/0000-0002-6125-7649; Popescu, Sorin/0000-0002-8155-8801; Zhou, Tan/0000-0002-9193-5113; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				APR	2019	224						1	11		10.1016/j.rse.2019.01.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.01.037													WOS:000462421200001

It is hard to obtain a geographically and statistically representative AGB dataset, which is limited by unpredictable environmental conditions and high economical cost. A spatially explicit AGB reference map was produced by airborne LiDAR data and calibrated by field measurements. Three different sampling strategies were designed to sample the reference AGB, PALSAR backscatter, and texture variables. Two parametric and four nonparametric models were established and validated based on the sampled dataset. Results showed that random stratified sampling that used LiDAR-evaluated forest age as stratification knowledge performed the best in the AGB sampling. The addition of backscatter texture variables improved the parametric model performance by an R-2 increase of 21% and a root-mean-square error ( RMSE) decrease of 10 Mgha(-1). One of the four nonparametric models, namely, the random forest regression model, obtained comparable performance ( R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 14.95 Mgha(-1)) to the parametric model. Higher estimation errors occurred in the forest stands with lower canopy cover or higher AGB levels. In conclusion, incorporating airborne LiDAR and PALSAR data was proven to be efficient in upscaling the AGB estimation to regional scale, which provides some guidance for future forest management over cold and arid areas.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a promising active remote sensing technology can provide reliable estimates of forest parameters. Area-based approach (ABA) is appropriate for wall-to-wall estimation of these parameters. In this study, we employed an ABA estimates of AGB by predicting individual tree AGB distributions over a subtropical forest study site. The total plot-level AGB was firstly predicted and the prediction of individual tree AGB distributions was generated by a two-parameter Weibull function. Then the fitted Weibull parameters were further estimated by LiDAR metrics. In addition, all models were assessed by regressed against LiDAR metrics in coniferous forest models. Finally, the stem density for each plot was evaluated by the parameter retrieval method with predicted total AGB and mean tree AGB derived from predicted Weibull parameters of individual tree AGB distribution. The results showed that the AGB and two Weibull parameters were generally predicted well (R-2=0.79-0.92, rRMSE=8.46%-20.80%). For stem density estimation, the regressed model explained 76% of variability in field stem density. The relationship between predicted and reference AGB distributions when the predicted frequencies of the AGB distributions were scaled to ground-truth stem number (mean Reynolds error index e(R)=30.83) was relatively stronger than when predicted frequencies were scaled to stem number predicted from LiDAR data (mean e(R)=33.67). This study demonstrated the distributions of individual forest structural parameters can potentially contribute to enrich ABA forest attributes inventory for airborne LiDAR.

Remote sensing of boreal forest biophysical and inventory parameters: a review	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union	DEC, 2006	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union				The growing need to manage vegetation resources at regional and global spatial scales has led to the increased use of remote sensing technologies among forestry scientists and managers for use in their investigation and supervision of forested landscapes. With an array of extant and developing airborne and satellite sensors, as well as multiple analysis techniques, there is a need to discern the most acceptable methods with which to examine remotely sensed imagery for forest ecosystem parameters. We have reviewed the literature on the remote sensing of boreal forests in order to determine if common frameworks for monitoring and assessing change in forest biophysical and inventory parameters could be developed. Other important remote sensing techniques such as those for change detection and land cover identification were also examined. Our review examined studies documented within the scientific literature that involved the extraction of information on forest parameters with remote sensing instruments. Primarily, we focused on studies within the boreal forest, which plays an important part in the Earth-atmosphere system and contributes significantly to the global economy through forest-derived products and resources. Additionally, the boreal forest has served as the primary investigation site for many important forest remote sensing discoveries. In this review, we considered the forest parameter that was examined, the remote sensing platform used, and the calibration and validation accuracies for the study. The most effective methodology for examining each parameter, considering spatial scale, is described. In general, a fusion of multiple sensors provided the most accurate approach for parameter extraction; however, this may not be the most appropriate methodology for all studies, due to spatial and temporal considerations. In each case, we attempted to consider which methodology works the best in a variety of scenarios.					; Lutz, David/HMO-5504-2023; Washington-Allen, Robert/AAG-1502-2019; Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009; Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009	Lutz, David/0000-0001-8780-7576; Shugart, Herman/0000-0002-1766-8379; Shugart, Herman/0000-0002-1766-8379													0703-8992	1712-7971					2008	34			2			S286	S313		10.5589/m08-057	http://dx.doi.org/10.5589/m08-057													WOS:000261858800007

With the advancement of individual tree detection techniques and the availability of multi-platform remotely sensed data, the individual tree-based approach (ITA) provides the potential of accurate and nondestructive fine AGB mapping. However, the performances of the two approaches on upscaling AGB from individual tree to stand level have not been thoroughly investigated. This study conducted the nondestructive AGB estimation using both ITA and ABA and compared the AGB estimates and their spatial uncertainties from an individual tree- to stand-level based on multi-platform LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI imagery, taking Larix olgensis that is one of the most notable afforestation tree species in northeastern China as an example. Results showed that the point cloud segmentation (PCS) outperformed CHM-based individual tree crown delineation algorithms and obtained the highest accuracy of individual tree AGB estimate (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 28.58 kg, rRMSE = 21.13%) for the dense larch plantations (about 1265 trees/ha). The plot-level AGB estimate aggregated by all detected trees and its uncertainty based on Monte Carlo simulation were 158.16 and 3.64 Mg center dot ha(-1), respectively. The average pixel-level AGB of larch plantations in Maorshan Forest Farm estimated by ITA and ABA were similar (129.66 v.s 144.38 Mg center dot ha(-1)). ITA outperformed ABA in terms of pixel-level AGB accuracy and spatial uncertainty of pixel-level and stand-level AGB estimates. The overestimation of low AGB values, typical in ABA, was effectively eliminated by the ITA. The upscaling frameworks proposed in this study for AGB estimation and spatial uncertainty quantification based on ITA and ABA could be extended to other plantations or uncomplex forests. This study contributes to the accurate quantification of AGB and understanding of the uncertainties in the carbon stock of forest ecosystems at multi-scales.					; Ma, Ye/IWD-8212-2023	Ma, Ye/0000-0002-6476-6967; zhao, yinghui/0000-0002-1933-8357													1548-1603	1943-7226				DEC 31	2022	59	1					722	743		10.1080/15481603.2022.2055381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2022.2055381													WOS:000778742200001

To clarify the relationship between mean canopy height determined by airborne LiDAR and forest timber volume and biomass of cool-temperate forests in northern Hokkaido, Japan, we conducted LiDAR observations covering the total area of the Teshio Experimental Forest (225 km(2)) of Hokkaido University and compared the results with ground surveys and previous studies. Timber volume and aboveground tree carbon content of the studied forest stands ranged from 101.43 to 480.40 m(3) ha(-1) and from 30.78 to 180.54 MgC ha-1, respectively. The LiDAR mean canopy height explained the variation among stands well (volume: r(2) = 0.80, RMSE = 55.04 m(3) ha(-1); aboveground tree carbon content: = 0.78, RMSE = 19.10 MgC ha(-1)) when one simple linear regression equation was used for all types (hardwood, coniferous, and mixed) of forest stands. The determination of a regression equation for each forest type did not improve the prediction power for hardwood (volume: r(2) = 0.84, RMSE = 62.66 m(3) ha(-1); aboveground tree carbon content: r(2) = 0.76, RMSE = 27.05 MgC ha(-1)) or coniferous forests (volume: r(2) = 0.75, RMSE = 51.07 m(3) ha(-1); aboveground tree carbon content: r(2) = 0.58, RMSE = 19.00 MgC ha(-1)). Thus, the combined regression equation that includes three forest types appears to be adequate for practical application to large-scale forest biomass estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pflugmacher, D; Cohen, WB; Kennedy, RE; Yang, ZQ				Pflugmacher, Dirk; Cohen, Warren B.; Kennedy, Robert E.; Yang, Zhiqiang			Using Landsat-derived disturbance and recovery history and lidar to map forest biomass dynamics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Improved monitoring of forest biomass and biomass change is needed to quantify natural and anthropogenic effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Landsat's temporal and spatial coverage, moderate spatial resolution, and long history of earth observations provide a unique opportunity for characterizing vegetation changes across large areas and long time scales. However, like with other multi-spectral passive optical sensors, Landsat's relationship of single-date reflectance with forest biomass diminishes under high leaf area and complex canopy conditions. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is largely determined by its disturbance and recovery history, we conceived a method that enhances Landsat's spectral relationships with biomass by including information on vegetation trends prior to the date for which estimates are desired. With recently developed algorithms that characterize trends in disturbance (e.g. year of onset, duration, and magnitude) and post-disturbance regrowth, it should now be possible to realize improved Landsat-based mapping of current biomass across large regions. Moreover, given that we now have 40 years of Landsat data, it should also be possible to use this approach to map historic biomass densities. In this study, we developed regression tree models to predict current forest aboveground biomass (AGB) for a mixed-conifer region in eastern Oregon (USA) using Landsat-based disturbance and recovery (DR) metrics. We employed the trajectory-fitting algorithm LandTrendr to characterize DR trends from yearly Landsat time series between 1972 and 2010. The most important DR predictors of AGB were associated with magnitude of disturbance, post-disturbance condition and post-disturbance recovery, whereas time since disturbance and pre-disturbance trends showed only weak correlations with AGB. Including DR metrics substantially improved predictions of AGB (RMSE = 30.3 Mg ha(-1), 27%) compared to models based on only single-date reflectance (RMSE = 39.6 Mg ha(-1), 35%). To determine the number of years required to adequately capture the effect of DR on AGB, we explored the relationship between time-series length and model prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy increased exponentially with increasing number of years across the entire observation period, suggesting that in this forest region the longer the historic record of disturbance and recovery metrics the more accurate the mapping of AGB. However, time series lengths of between 10 and 20 years were adequate to significantly improve model predictions, and lengths of as little as 5 years still had a meaningful impact To test the concept of historic biomass prediction, we applied our model to Landsat time series from 1972-1993 and estimated AGB biomass change between 1993 and 2007. Our estimates compared well with historic inventory data, demonstrating that long-term Landsat observations of DR processes can aid in monitoring AGB and AGB change. Instead of directly linking Landsat data with the limited amount of available field-based AGB data, in this study we used the field data to map AGB with airborne lidar and then sampled the lidar data for model training and error assessment By using lidar data to build and test our prediction model, this study illustrates that lidar data have great value for scaling between field measurements and Landsat data.

Over the last years, the spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor specifically designed to acquire forest structure information, Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), has been used to extract forest canopy height information over large areas. Yet, GEDI has no spatial coverage for most forested areas in Canada and other high latitude regions. On the other hand, the spaceborne LiDAR called Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides a global coverage but was not specially developed to study forested ecosystems. Nonetheless, both spaceborne LiDAR sensors obtain point-based information, making spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation very challenging. This study compared the performance of both spaceborne LiDAR, GEDI and ICESat-2, combined with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 and -2 data to produce continuous canopy height maps in Canada for the year 2020. A set-aside dataset and airborne LiDAR (ALS) from a national LiDAR campaign were used for accuracy assessment. Both maps overestimated canopy height in relation to ALS data, but GEDI had a better performance than ICESat-2 with a mean difference (MD) of 0.9 m and 2.9 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.2 m and 5.2 m, respectively. However, as both GEDI and ALS have no coverage in most of the hemi-boreal forests, ICESat-2 captures the tall canopy heights expected for these forests better than GEDI. PALSAR-2 HV polarization was the most important covariate to predict canopy height, showing the great potential of L-band in comparison to C-band from Sentinel-1 or optical data from Sentinel-2. The approach proposed here can be used operationally to produce annual canopy height maps for areas that lack GEDI and ICESat-2 coverage.

It can be anticipated that this integration approach needs to deal with an expanded set of variables and scale-related challenges. To achieve satisfactory accuracy in real-world applications, further exploration is needed to optimize AGB models by selecting appropriate scales and variables.MethodsThis study examined the impact of LiDAR point cloud-derived metrics on estimation accuracies at different scales, ranging from 2 to 16 m cell sizes. We integrated WorldView-2 imagery with LiDAR data to construct biomass models and developed a genetic algorithm-based wrapper for variable selection and parameter tuning in artificial neural networks (GA-ANN wrapper).ResultsOur findings indicated that the highest accuracies in estimating AGB were yielded by 4 m and 6 m cell sizes, followed by 8 m and 10 m, associated with the dimensions of vegetation canopies and sampling plots. Models integrating WorldView-2 and LiDAR data outperformed those using each data source individually, reducing RMSEr by 5.80% and 3.89%, respectively. Combining these data sources can capture the canopy spectral responses and vertical vegetation structure. The GA-ANN wrapper model decreased RMSEr by 1.69% over the ANN model and dwindled the number of variables from 38 to 9. The selected variables included vegetation density, height, species, and vegetation indices.ConclusionsThe appropriate cell size for AGB estimation should consider the sizes of vegetation canopies, tree densities, and sampling plots. The GA-ANN wrapper effectively reduced variables and achieved the highest accuracy. Additionally, canopy spectral and vertical structure information are vital for accurate AGB estimation. Our study offered insights into optimizing mangrove AGB models by integrating optical and LiDAR data. The approach, data, model, and indices employed in this research can effectively predict AGB estimates of any other forest types or vegetation cover types in different climate regions.					; Zhu, Yuanhui/ABG-6977-2021; Liu, Kai/K-7307-2015	ZHU, YUANHUI/0000-0002-0474-5945; Liu, Kai/0000-0002-1829-7557														2192-1709				NOV 14	2024	13	1							85	10.1186/s13717-024-00566-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-024-00566-w													WOS:001355102600001

The illuminated scene is the temperate forest at the Eifel National Park, North-West Germany. Dominant species are beech and spruce trees. Forest height ranges roughly from 10 to 30 m, with peaks up to over 40 m. Forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) ranges from 20 to 300 Mg/ha, with peaks up to over 400 Mg/ha. SAR data include P-, L-, and C-band surveys acquired by flying up to 30 trajectories in two headings to provide tomographic imaging capabilities. L-and C-band data were acquired by simultaneously flying two aircraft to gather bistatic data along different trajectories.The SAR dataset is complemented by 3D structural canopy measurements made via terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle lidar (UAV-L) and airborne laser scanning (ALS), and in-situ forest census. This unique combination of SAR tomographic and multi-scale lidar data allows for direct comparison of canopy structural metrics across wavelength and scale, including vertical profiles of canopy wood and foliage density, and per-tree and plot-level above ground biomass (AGB). The resulting TomoSense data-set is free and openly available at ESA for any research purpose. The data-set includes ALS-derived maps of forest height and AGB, forest parameters at the level of single trees, TLS raw data, and plot-average TLS vertical profiles. The provided SAR data are coregistered, phase calibrated, and ground steered, to enable a direct implementation of any kind of interferometric or tomographic processing without having to deal with the subtleties of airborne SAR processing. Moreover, the data-base comprises SAR tomographic cubes representing forest scattering in 3D both in Radar and geographical coordinates, intended for use by non-Radar experts. For its unique features and completeness, the TomoSense data-set is intended to serve as an important basis for future research on microwave scattering from forested areas in the context of future Earth Observation missions.

Thus, how to estimate and map regional forest AGB quickly and accurately attracts more interests of researchers. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) is an advanced SAR technique developed in recent years, which has a wide range application in forest AGB estimation. In this paper, we proposed a multi-feature-based modeling method to estimate forest AGB by fitting backscattered power of TomoSAR vertical profile. The procedure of the proposed method includes four parts: (1) Processing TomoSAR data to obtain the backscattered power of vertical profile. (2) Fitting the backscattered power of the vertical profile. (3) Analyzing the fitted backscattered power distribution characteristic of the vertical profile. (4) Extracting the TomoSAR vertical profile features according to the forest AGB measurement factors based on the dendrometry theory. In this paper, we proposed two new features like the forest average height weighted by backscattered power (BPFAH) and the total length of the backscattered power curve (LBPC) as supplement features to estimate forest AGB by TomoSAR technique. We also used the traditional TomoSAR features including backscattered power at specific height layer of vertical power profile (BPV) and forest average height (FAH) for AGB estimation. After the feature selection, the selected features and the ground field data of the forest AGB were used for regression and modeling. Then the forest AGB was estimated and the accuracy was validated. The results showed that the accuracy of proposed method is 90.73%, and RMSE is 42.45 t/ha. Finally, we discussed the performance of our proposed method compared with traditional methods.

C.			How to consider the effects of time of day, beam strength, and snow cover in ICESat-2 based estimation of boreal forest biomass?	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The objective of this study was to explore the effects of (1) the presence/absence of snow and snow depth, (2) solar noise, i.e., day/night and sun angle observations, and (3) strong/weak beam differences on ICESat2 data in the context of data utility for forest AGB estimation. The framework of the study is multiphase modeling, where AGB field data and wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) and Sentinel-2 data are used to produce proxy ALS plots on ICESat-2 track positions. Models between the predicted proxy AGB and the ICESat-2 photon data are then formulated and evaluated by subsets, such as only strong beam data captured in snowy conditions. Our results indicate that, if possible, strong beam night data from snowless conditions should be used in AGB estimation, because our models showed clearly smallest RMSE (26.9%) for this data subset. If more data are needed, we recommend using only strong beam data and constructing separate models for the different data subsets. In the order of increasing RMSE%, the next best options were snow/night/strong (30.4%), snow/day/strong (33.5%), and snowless/day/strong (34.1%). Weak beam data from snowy night conditions could also be used if necessary (31.0%).					; Korhonen, Lauri/H-4179-2019; Popescu, Sorin/D-5981-2015	Toivonen, Janne/0000-0003-1319-3035; Saarela, Svetlana/0000-0002-9044-7249; Popescu, Sorin/0000-0002-8155-8801													0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2022	280								113174	10.1016/j.rse.2022.113174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113174		JUL 2022											WOS:000839328200001

M.; Qiu, Shi; Yin, Changming			Biomass estimation in dense tropical forest using multiple information from single-baseline P-band PolInSAR data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												With the upcoming BIOMASS mission, P-band PolInSAR is expected to provide new perspectives on global forest aboveground biomass (AGB). However, its performance has not yet been fully evaluated for dense tropical forests with complex structure and very high biomass. Based on the TropiSAR campaign in French Guiana, we explored the challenges of the three most commonly used PolInSAR measures to capture AGB in tropical forests; coherence magnitude, interferometric phase, and backscatter. An improved AGB estimation approach was developed by integrating multiple information derived from single-baseline PolInSAR data. The approach involves ground-volume backscatter decomposition and combines volume backscatter with the retrieved forest height. Volume backscatter from the forest canopy was the best predictor of AGB for tropical forests, whereas the ground backscatter contribution was affected by the complex underlying surface and terrain slope. Both LiDAR- and PolInSAR-derived forest heights showed limited correlation with high AGB due to the varying forest basal area. The linear combination of PolInSAR-derived forest height and volume backscatter complemented each other and produced improved AGB estimates. Comparing three different PolInSAR data pairs, the proposed method produced an AGB map with an average R-2 of 0.7 and RMSE of 34 tons/ha (relative RMSE of 9.4%) at a spatial resolution of 125 x 125 m(2) for biomass between 250-500 tons/ha.

Quantifying Boreal Forest Structure and Composition Using UAV Structure from Motion	FORESTS												The vast extent and inaccessibility of boreal forest ecosystems are barriers to routine monitoring of forest structure and composition. In this research, we bridge the scale gap between intensive but sparse plot measurements and extensive remote sensing studies by collecting forest inventory variables at the plot scale using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a structure from motion (SfM) approach. At 20 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) subplots in interior Alaska, we acquired overlapping imagery and generated dense, 3D, RGB (red, green, blue) point clouds. We used these data to model forest type at the individual crown scale as well as subplot-scale tree density (TD), basal area (BA), and aboveground biomass (AGB). We achieved 85% cross-validation accuracy for five species at the crown level. Classification accuracy was maximized using three variables representing crown height, form, and color. Consistent with previous UAV-based studies, SfM point cloud data generated robust models of TD (r(2) = 0.91), BA (r(2) = 0.79), and AGB (r(2) = 0.92), using a mix of plot-and crown-scale information. Precise estimation of TD required either segment counts or species information to differentiate black spruce from mixed white spruce plots. The accuracy of species-specific estimates of TD, BA, and AGB at the plot scale was somewhat variable, ranging from accurate estimates of black spruce TD (+/1%) and aspen BA (-2%) to misallocation of aspen AGB (+118%) and white spruce AGB (-50%). These results convey the potential utility of SfM data for forest type discrimination in FIA plots and the remaining challenges to develop classification approaches for species-specific estimates at the plot scale that are more robust to segmentation error.

Supervised Segmentation of Ultra-High-Density Drone Lidar for Large-Area Mapping of Individual Trees	REMOTE SENSING												We applied a supervised individual-tree segmentation algorithm to ultra-high-density drone lidar in a temperate mountain forest in the southern Czech Republic. We compared the number of trees correctly segmented, stem diameter at breast height (DBH), and tree height from drone-lidar segmentations to field-inventory measurements and segmentations from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data acquired within two days of the drone-lidar acquisition. Our analysis detected 51% of the stems >15 cm DBH, and 87% of stems >50 cm DBH. Errors of omission were much more common for smaller trees than for larger ones, and were caused by removal of points prior to segmentation using a low-intensity and morphological filter. Analysis of segmented trees indicates a strong linear relationship between DBH from drone-lidar segmentations and TLS data. The slope of this relationship is 0.93, the intercept is 4.28 cm, and the r(2) is 0.98. However, drone lidar and TLS segmentations overestimated DBH for the smallest trees and underestimated DBH for the largest trees in comparison to field data. We evaluate the impact of random error in point locations and variation in footprint size, and demonstrate that random error in point locations is likely to cause an overestimation bias for small-DBH trees. A Random Forest classifier correctly identified broadleaf and needleleaf trees using stem and crown geometric properties with overall accuracy of 85.9%. We used these classifications and DBH estimates from drone-lidar segmentations to apply allometric scaling equations to segmented individual trees. The stand-level aboveground biomass (AGB) estimate using these data is 76% of the value obtained using a traditional field inventory. We demonstrate that 71% of the omitted AGB is due to segmentation errors of omission, and the remaining 29% is due to DBH estimation errors. Our analysis indicates that high-density measurements from low-altitude drone flight can produce DBH estimates for individual trees that are comparable to TLS. These data can be collected rapidly throughout areas large enough to produce landscape-scale estimates. With additional refinement, these estimates could augment or replace manual field inventories, and could support the calibration and validation of current and forthcoming space missions.					; Cushman, K./W-1713-2019; Krucek, Martin/B-9394-2015; Kral, Kamil/E-4415-2014	Cushman, Katherine/0000-0002-3464-1151; Missarov, Azim/0000-0001-9881-6531; Král, Kamil/0000-0002-3848-2119; Krucek, Martin/0000-0002-3137-2259														2072-4292				OCT	2020	12	19							3260	10.3390/rs12193260	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12193260													WOS:000587178000001

Some studies have leveraged ALS data as intermediate variables to amplify sample sizes, thereby reducing costs and enhancing sample representativeness and model accuracy, but the cost issue remains in larger-scale estimations. Satellite LiDAR data, offering a broader dataset that can be acquired quickly with lower costs, can serve as an alternative intermediate variable for sample expansion. In this study, we employed a three-stage up-scaling approach to estimate forest AGB and introduced a method for quantifying estimation uncertainty. Based on the established three-stage general-hierarchical-model-based estimation inference (3sGHMB), an RK-3sGHMB inference method is proposed to make use of the regression-kriging (RK) method, and then it is compared with conventional model-based inference (CMB), general hierarchical model-based inference (GHMB), and improved general hierarchical model-based inference (RK-GHMB) to estimate forest AGB and uncertainty at both the pixel and forest farm levels. This study was carried out by integrating plot data, sampled ALS data, wall-to-wall Sentinel-2A data, and airborne P-SAR data. The results show that the accuracy of CMB (Radj2 = 0.37, RMSE = 33.95 t/ha, EA = 63.28%) is lower than that of GHMB (Radj2 = 0.38, RMSE = 33.72 t/ha, EA = 63.53%), while it is higher than that of 3sGHMB (Radj2 = 0.27, RMSE = 36.58 t/ha, EA = 60.43%). Notably, RK-GHMB (Radj2 = 0.60, RMSE= 27.07 t/ha, EA = 70.72%) and RK-3sGHMB (Radj2 = 0.55, RMSE = 28.55 t/ha, EA = 69.13%) demonstrate significant accuracy enhancements compared to GHMB and 3sGHMB. For population AGB estimation, the precision of the proposed RK-3sGHMB (p = 94.44%) is the highest, providing that there are sufficient sample sizes in the third stage, followed by RK-GHMB (p = 93.32%) with sufficient sample sizes in the second stage, GHMB (p = 90.88%), 3sGHMB (p = 88.91%), and CMB (p = 87.96%). Further analysis reveals that the three-stage model, considering spatial correlation at the third stage, can improve estimation accuracy, but the prerequisite is that the sample size in the third stage must be sufficient. For large-scale estimation, the RK-3sGHMB model proposed herein offers certain advantages.					; Zhao, Lei/AFR-6926-2022	Zhao, Lei/0000-0001-7546-0608; 														2072-4292				FEB	2025	17	4							671	10.3390/rs17040671	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17040671													WOS:001430811200001

Most field-based inventory and remote sensing methods fail to account for the lower stratum vegetation (i.e., shrubs and grasses), and are thus underrepresenting the carbon storage potential of savanna ecosystems. For detailed analyses at the local scale, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has proven to be a promising remote sensing technology over the past decade. Accordingly, several review articles already exist on the use of TLS for characterizing 3D vegetation structure. However, a gap exists on the spatial concentrations of TLS studies according to biome for accurate vegetation structure estimation. A comprehensive review was conducted through a meta-analysis of 113 relevant research articles using 18 attributes. The review covered a range of aspects, including the global distribution of TLS studies, parameters retrieved from TLS point clouds and retrieval methods. The review also examined the relationship between the TLS retrieval method and the overall accuracy in parameter extraction. To date, TLS has mainly been used to characterize vegetation in temperate, boreal/taiga and tropical forests, with only little emphasis on savannas. TLS studies in the savanna focused on the extraction of very few vegetation parameters (e.g., DBH and height) and did not consider the shrub contribution to the overall Above Ground Biomass (AGB). Future work should therefore focus on developing new and adjusting existing algorithms for vegetation parameter extraction in the savanna biome, improving predictive AGB models through 3D reconstructions of savanna trees and shrubs as well as quantifying AGB change through the application of multi-temporal TLS. The integration of data from various sources and platforms e.g., TLS with airborne LiDAR is recommended for improved vegetation parameter extraction (including AGB) at larger spatial scales. The review highlights the huge potential of TLS for accurate savanna vegetation extraction by discussing TLS opportunities, challenges and potential future research in the savanna biome.

However, when wall-to-wall ALS coverage is cost prohibitive or logistically challenging, alternative approaches are needed for forest mapping. We evaluated an indirect approach for extending ALS-based maps of forest attributes using medium resolution satellite and environmental data. First, we developed ALS-based models and predicted a suite of forest attributes for a 950 km(2) study area covered by wall-to-wall ALS data. Then, we used samples extracted from the ALS-based predictions to model and map these attributes with satellite and environmental data for an extended 5600 km(2) area with similar forest and ecological conditions. All attributes were predicted well with the ALS data (R-2 0.83; RMSD% < 26). The satellite and environmental models developed using the ALS-based predictions resulted in increased correspondence between observed and predicted values by 13-49% and decreased prediction errors by 8-28% compared with models developed directly with the ground plots. Improvements were observed for both multiple regression and random forest models, and for the suite of forest attributes assessed. We concluded that the use of ALS-based predictions in this study improved the estimation of forest attributes beyond an approach linking ground plots directly to the satellite and environmental data.

It has been suggested that estimates can be improved by building species- or strata-specific biomass models. However, few studies have attempted a systematic analysis of the benefits of such stratification, especially in combination with other factors such as sensor type, statistical prediction method and sampling design of the reference inventory data. We addressed this topic by analyzing the impact of stratifying forest data into three classes (broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest). We compare predictive accuracy (a) between the strata (b) to a case without stratification for a set of pre- selected predictors from airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data obtained in a managed mixed forest site in southwestern Germany. We used 5 commonly applied algorithms for biomass predictions on bootstrapped subsamp les of the data to obtain cross validated RMSE and r(2) diagnostics. Those values were analyzed in a factorial design by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to rank the relative importance of each factor. Selected models were used for wall-to-wall mapping of biomass estimates and their associated uncertainty. The results revealed marginal advantages for the strata-specific prediction models over the unstratified ones, which were more obvious on the wall-to-wall mapped area-based predictions. Yet further tests are necessary to establish the generality of these results. Input data type and statistical prediction method are concluded to remain the two most crucial factors for the quality of remote sensingassisted biomass models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	García, M; Saatchi, S; Ustin, S; Balzter, H				Garcia, Mariano; Saatchi, Sassan; Ustin, Susan; Balzter, Heiko			Modelling forest canopy height by integrating airborne LiDAR samples with satellite Radar and multispectral imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Spatially-explicit information on forest structure is paramount to estimating aboveground carbon stocks for designing sustainable forest management strategies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. LiDAR measurements provide samples of forest structure that must be integrated with satellite imagery to predict and to map landscape scale variations of forest structure. Here we evaluate the capability of existing satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with multispectral data to estimate forest canopy height over five study sites across two biomes in North America, namely temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests. Pixel size affected the modelling results, with an improvement in model performance as pixel resolution coarsened from 25 m to 100 m. Likewise, the sample size was an important factor in the uncertainty of height prediction using the Support Vector Machine modelling approach. Larger sample size yielded better results but the improvement stabilised when the sample size reached approximately 10% of the study area. We also evaluated the impact of surface moisture (soil and vegetation moisture) on the modelling approach. Whereas the impact of surface moisture had a moderate effect on the proportion of the variance explained by the model (up to 14%), its impact was more evident in the bias of the models with bias reaching values up to 4 m. Averaging the incidence angle corrected radar backscatter coefficient (gamma degrees) reduced the impact of surface moisture on the models and improved their performance at all study sites, with R-2 ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, RMSE between 2.02 and 5.64 and bias between 0.02 and -0.06, respectively, at 100 m spatial resolution. An evaluation of the relative importance of the variables in the model performance showed that for the study sites located within the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome ALOS-PALSAR HV polarised backscatter was the most important variable, with Landsat Tasselled Cap Transformation components barely contributing to the models for two of the study sites whereas it had a significant contribution at the third one. Over the temperate conifer forests, Landsat Tasselled Cap variables contributed more than the ALOS-PALSAR HV band to predict the landscape height variability. In all cases, incorporation of multispectral data improved the retrieval of forest canopy height and reduced the estimation uncertainty for tall forests. Finally, we concluded that models trained at one study site had higher uncertainty when applied to other sites, but a model developed from multiple sites performed equally to site-specific models to predict forest canopy height. This result suggest that a biome level model developed from several study sites can be used as a reliable estimator of biome-level forest structure from existing satellite imagery.

J	Zhang, YZ; Liang, SL				Zhang, Yuzhen; Liang, Shunlin			Fusion of Multiple Gridded Biomass Datasets for Generating a Global Forest Aboveground Biomass Map	REMOTE SENSING												Many advanced satellite estimation methods have been developed, but global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) products remain largely uncertain. In this study, we explored data fusion techniques to generate a global forest AGB map for the 2000s at 0.01-degree resolution with improved accuracy by integrating ten existing local or global maps. The error removal and simple averaging algorithm, which is efficient and makes no assumption about the data and associated errors, was proposed to integrate these ten forest AGB maps. We first compiled the global reference AGB from in situ measurements and high-resolution AGB data that were originally derived from field data and airborne lidar data and determined the errors of each forest AGB map at the pixels with corresponding reference AGB values. Based on the errors determined from reference AGB data, the pixel-by-pixel errors associated with each of the ten AGB datasets were estimated from multiple predictors (e.g., leaf area index, forest canopy height, forest cover, land surface elevation, slope, temperature, and precipitation) using the random forest algorithm. The estimated pixel-by-pixel errors were then removed from the corresponding forest AGB datasets, and finally, global forest AGB maps were generated by combining the calibrated existing forest AGB datasets using the simple averaging algorithm. Cross-validation using reference AGB data showed that the accuracy of the fused global forest AGB map had an R-squared of 0.61 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 53.68 Mg/ha, which is better than the reported accuracies (R-squared of 0.56 and RMSE larger than 80 Mg/ha) in the literature. Intercomparison with previous studies also suggested that the fused AGB estimates were much closer to the reference AGB values. This study attempted to integrate existing forest AGB datasets for generating a global forest AGB map with better accuracy and moved one step forward for our understanding of the global terrestrial carbon cycle by providing improved benchmarks of global forest carbon stocks.

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument-a new-generation spaceborne lidar system from NASA-provides the first global coverage of high-resolution 3D altimetry data aimed specifically for mapping Earth's forests, but its performance is yet to be tested for large parts of the world. Here, our goal is to evaluate the accuracies of GEDI in measuring terrain, forest vertical structures, and AGB in reference to independent airborne lidar data over temperate and tropical forests in North America. We compared GEDI-derived elevations and canopy heights (e.g., relative height percentiles such as RH50 and RH100) with those from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) or from two airborne lidar systems: the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) and Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral and Thermal system (G-LiHT). We also estimated GEDI's geolocation errors by matching GEDI waveforms and G-LiHT pseudo-waveforms. We assessed the predictive power of GEDI metrics in estimating AGB using Random Forests regression. Results showed that GEDI-derived ground elevations correlated strongly those from LVIS, G-LiHT, and LVIS (R-2 > 0.91), but with nonnegligible RMSEs of 5.7 m (G-LiHT), 3.1 m (LVIS), and 10.9 m (SRTM). GEDI canopy heights had poorer correlation with LVIS (e.g., R-2 = 0.44 for RH100) than with G-LiHT (e.g., R-2 = 0.60 for RH100). The estimated horizontal geolocation errors of GEDI footprints averaged 6.5 meters, comparable to the nominal accuracy of 9 m. Correction for the locational errors improved the correlation of GEDI vs G-LiHT canopy heights significantly, on average by 53% (e.g., R-2 from 0.57 to 0.82 for RH50). GEDI canopy metrics were useful for predicting AGB (R-2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 19.1 Mg/Ha), with the maximum canopy height RH100 being the most useful predictor. Our results highlight the importance of accommodating or correcting for GEDI geolocation errors for estimating forest characteristics and provide empirical evidence on the utility of GEDI for monitoring global biomass dynamics from space.

J	Badreldin, N; Sanchez-Azofeifa, A				Badreldin, Nasem; Sanchez-Azofeifa, Arturo			Estimating Forest Biomass Dynamics by Integrating Multi-Temporal Landsat Satellite Images with Ground and Airborne LiDAR Data in the Coal Valley Mine, Alberta, Canada	REMOTE SENSING												Assessing biomass dynamics is highly critical for monitoring ecosystem balance and its response to climate change and anthropogenic activities. In this study, we introduced a direct link between Landsat vegetation spectral indices and ground/airborne LiDAR data; this integration was established to estimate the biomass dynamics over various years using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. Our case study is located in an area highly affected by coal mining activity. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI and EVI2), chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI), and tasseled cap transformations were used as vegetation spectral indices to estimate canopy height. In turn, canopy height was used to predict a coniferous forest's biomass using Jenkins allometric and Lambert and Ung allometric equations. The biophysical properties of 700 individual trees at eight different scan stations in the study area were obtained using high-resolution ground LiDAR. Nine models (H-i) were established to discover the best relationship between the canopy height model (CHM) from the airborne LiDAR and the vegetation spectral indices (VSIs) from Landsat images for the year 2005, and HB9 (Jenkins allometric equation) and HY9 (Lambert and Ung allometric equation) proved to be the best models (r(2) = 0.78; root mean square error (RMSE) = 44 Mg/H, r(2) = 0.67; RMSE = 58.01 Mg/H, respectively; p < 0.001) for estimating the canopy height and the biomass. This model accurately captured the most affected areas (deforested) and the reclaimed areas (forested) in the study area. Five years were chosen for studying the biomass change: 1988, 1990, 2001, 2005, and 2011. Additionally, four pixel-based image comparisons were analyzed (i.e., 1988-1990, 1990-2005, 2005-2009, and 2009-2011), and Mann-Kendall statistics for the subsets of years were obtained. The detected change showed that, in general, the environment in the study area was recovering and regaining its initial biomass after the dramatic decrease that occurred in 2005 as a result of intensive mining activities and disturbance.

Mapping vegetation height and identifying the northern forest limit across Canada using ICESat-2, Landsat time series and topographic data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The northern forest-tundra ecotone is one of the fastest warming regions of the globe. Models of vegetation change generally predict a northward advance of boreal forests and corresponding retreat of the tundra. Previous satellite remote sensing analyses in this region have focused on mapping vegetation greenness and tree cover derived from optical multi -spectral sensors. Changes in vegetation structure relating to height and biomass are less frequently investigated due to limited availability of lidar data over space and time in comparison with optical platforms. As such, there is an opportunity to combine lidar and optical remote sensing products for continuous mapping of vegetation structure at high -latitudes, with an emphasis on the forest-tundra transition. In this study, we used lidar data from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) to classify canopy presence/absence, and predict canopy height across 120 million hectares of the Canadian forest-tundra ecotone at 30 m spatial resolution. Spatially continuous predictors derived from the Landsat satellite archive (2012-2021) and the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) Digital Elevation Model were used to extrapolate 98th percentile canopy height from the ICESat-2 Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08) product using Random Forests models developed in R (version 4.2.2). Model accuracy was assessed using data from the Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS), a large-footprint airborne lidar system. The overall accuracy of the canopy presence classification was 89%, and canopy presence was detected with 88% accuracy. Models of vegetation height showed an overall R 2 of 0.54 and RMSE of 2.09 m. Finally, we used these methods to map the limit of continuous 3 m forest across Canada and compared our model outputs with forest cover from the MODIS and Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields datasets. This work demonstrates the challenges and potential for mapping horizontal and vertical vegetation structure within sparse, high latitude forests using both lidar and optical remote sensing data.

Regional aboveground forest biomass using airborne and spaceborne LiDAR in Quebec	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Aboveground dry biomass was estimated for the 1.3 M km(2) forested area south of the treeline in the eastern Canadian province of Quebec by combining data from an airborne and spaceborne LiDAR, a Landsat ETM+ land cover map, a Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, ground inventory plots, and vegetation zone maps. Plot-level biomass was calculated using allometric relationships between tree attributes and biomass. A small footprint portable laser profiler then flew over these inventory plots to develop a generic airborne LiDAR-based biomass equation (R-2=0.65, n=207). The same airborne LiDAR system flew along four portions of orbits of the ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). A square-root transformed equation was developed to predict airborne profiling LiDAR estimates of aboveground dry biomass from GLAS waveform parameters combined with an SRTM slope index (R-2=0.59, n = 1325). Using the 104,044 quality-filtered GLAS pulses obtained during autumn 2003 from 97 orbits over the study area, we then predicted aboveground dry biomass for the main vegetation areas of Quebec as well as for the entire Province south of the treeline. Including cover type covariances both within and between GLAS orbits increased standard errors of the estimates by two to five times at the vegetation zone level and as much as threefold at the provincial level. Aboveground biomass for the whole study area averaged 39.0 +/- 2.2 (standard error) Mg ha(-1) and totalled 4.9 +/- 0.3 Pg. Biomass distributions were 12.6% northern hardwoods, 12.6% northern mixedwood, 38.4% commercial boreal, 13% non-commercial boreal, 14.2% taiga, and 9.2% treed tundra. Non-commercial forests represented 36% of the estimated aboveground biomass, thus highlighting the importance of remote northern forests to C sequestration. This study has shown that space-based forest inventories of northern forests could be an efficient way of estimating the amount, distribution, and uncertainty of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks at large spatial scales.

However, existing research in this field often lacks a comprehensive methodology for capturing tree-level AGB dynamics using multitemporal remote sensing techniques. In this study, we quantitatively characterized spatiotemporal variations of tree-level AGB in boreal natural secondary forests in the Greater Khingan Mountains region using multitemporal light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquired in 2012, 2016, and 2022. Our methodology emphasized improving the accuracy of individual tree segmentation algorithms by taking advantage of canopy structure heterogeneity. We introduced a novel three-dimensional metric, similar to crown width, integrated with tree height to calculate tree-level AGB. Moreover, we address the challenge of underestimating tree-level metrics resulting from low pulse density, ensuring accurate monitoring of AGB changes for every two acquisitions. The results showed that the LiDAR-based Delta AGB explained 62% to 70% of the variance of field-measured Delta AGB at the tree level. Furthermore, when aggregating the tree-level AGB estimates to the plot level, the results also exhibited robust and reasonable accuracy. We identified the average annual change in tree-level AGB and tree height across the study region, quantifying them at 2.23 kg and 0.25 m, respectively. Furthermore, we highlighted the importance of the Gini coefficient, which represents canopy structure heterogeneity, as a key environmental factor that explains relative AGB change rates at the plot level. Our contribution lies in proposing a comprehensive framework for analyzing tree-level AGB dynamics using multitemporal LiDAR data, paving the way for a nuanced understanding of fine-scale forest dynamics. We argue that LiDAR technology is becoming increasingly valuable in monitoring tree dynamics, enabling the application of high-resolution ecosystem dynamics products to elucidate ecological issues and address environmental challenges.

Reducing classification error of grassland overgrowth by combing low-density lidar acquisitions and optical remote sensing data	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Mapping structural changes in vegetation dynamics has, for a long time, been carried out using satellite images, orthophotos and, more recently, airborne lidar acquisitions. Lidar has established its position as providing accurate material for structure-based analyses but its limited availability, relatively short history, and lack of spectral information, however, are generally impeding the use of lidar data for change detection purposes. A potential solution in respect of detecting both contemporary vegetation structures and their previous trajectories is to combine lidar acquisitions with optical remote sensing data, which can substantially extend the coverage, span and spectral range needed for vegetation mapping. In this study, we tested the simultaneous use of a single low-density lidar data set, a series of Landsat satellite frames and two high-resolution orthophotos to detect vegetation succession related to grassland overgrowth, i.e. encroachment of woody plants into semi-natural grasslands. We built several alternative Random Forest models with different sets of variables and tested the applicability of respective data sources for change detection purposes, aiming at distinguishing unchanged grassland and woodland areas from overgrown grasslands. Our results show that while lidar alone provides a solid basis for indicating structural differences between grassland and woodland vegetation, and orthophoto-generated variables alone are better in detecting successional changes, their combination works considerably better than its respective parts. More specifically, a model combining all the used data sets reduces the total error from 17.0% to 11.0% and omission error of detecting overgrown grasslands from 56.9% to 31.2%, when compared to model constructed solely based on lidar data. This pinpoints the efficiency of the approach where lidar-generated structural metrics are combined with optical and multitemporal observations, providing a workable framework to identify structurally oriented and dynamically organized landscape phenomena, such as grassland overgrowth.

Stand-level analysis of airborne LiDAR data has been demonstrated to accurately estimate long-term TSD (similar to 100 years), but large-scale coverage of airborne LiDAR remains costly. NASA's spaceborne LiDAR Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument, launched in December 2018, is providing billions of measurements of tropical and temperate forest canopies around the globe. GEDI is a spatial sampling instrument and, as such, does not provide wall-to-wall data. GEDI's lasers illuminate ground footprints, which are separated by similar to 600 m across-track and similar to 60 m along-track, so new approaches are needed to generate wall-to-wall maps from the discrete measurements. In this paper, we studied the feasibility of a data fusion approach between GEDI and Landsat for wall-to-wall mapping of TSD. We tested the methodology on a similar to 52,500-ha area located in central Idaho (USA), where an extensive record of stand-replacing disturbances is available, starting in 1870. GEDI data were simulated over the nominal two-year planned mission lifetime from airborne LiDAR data and used for TSD estimation using a random forest (RF) classifier. Image segmentation was performed on Landsat-8 data, obtaining image-objects representing forest stands needed for the spatial extrapolation of estimated TSD from the discrete GEDI locations. We quantified the influence of (1) the forest stand map delineation, (2) the sample size of the training dataset, and (3) the number of GEDI footprints per stand on the accuracy of estimated TSD. The results show that GEDI-Landsat data fusion would allow for TSD estimation in stands covering similar to 95% of the study area, having the potential to reconstruct the long-term disturbance history of temperate even-aged forests with accuracy (median root mean square deviation = 22.14 years, median BIAS = 1.70 years, 60.13% of stands classified within 10 years of the reference disturbance date) comparable to the results obtained in the same study area with airborne LiDAR.					; Boschetti, Luigi/C-6198-2008	Sánchez-López, Nuria/0000-0002-0455-3951; Boschetti, Luigi/0000-0001-6525-4413; Duncanson, Laura/0000-0003-4031-3493; Hudak, Anew/0000-0001-7480-1458														2072-4292				NOV	2020	12	21							3506	10.3390/rs12213506	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12213506													WOS:000589378600001

Surveys based on airborne lidar and in situ data fulfill the accuracy requirements but lack global applicability, while the globally available optical, lidar, and radar backscatter data suffer from poor sensitivity to AGBD and/or spatial resolution. We here assess the global applicability of an alternative approach that exploits the publicly available, interferometric radar-based Copernicus digital elevation model (DEM) paired with a coarse-resolution digital terrain model (DTM). For eleven boreal, temperate and tropical test sites on four continents, we show that the DEM-DTM difference represents the average canopy elevation above ground and is well-correlated with AGBD maps derived from airborne lidar and in situ data. Within each climate zone, the estimated power law model parameters varied moderately and indicated an almost linear relationship between AGBD and the DEM-DTM difference. Using site-specific power law models resulted in an ensemble root-meansquare difference (RMSD) at 50 m resolution of 43.7 t/ha (18 % of the average AGBD of 246 t/ha) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.90. Climate zone-specific and a single, global scaling model performed almost equally well, with an overall RMSD of 20-21 % and an R2 value of 0.87. The global scaling model performed substantially better than the ESA Climate Change Initiative Biomass dataset on AGBD and indicated high potential for global application with the upcoming near-global DTM from ESA's BIOMASS mission (launched on 29 April 2025).

In this study, bistatic TanDEM-X (TDX) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data were used to derive digital surface models (DSMs) of forest areas using SAR interferometry (InSAR). The capability of change features derived from bitemporal InSAR DSMs to detect forest height (90th percentile of canopy height distribution, H90) and density variations was investigated. Moreover, changes in the forest above-ground biomass (AGB) were estimated from height changes between two InSAR DSMs. Bi-temporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, aerial orthoimages and an ALS-based AGB change map from a study area in Southern Finland were used as references. The results indicate that the InSAR height change of a forested area correlates more with vegetation density change than with height change. The correlation between the InSAR mean height change and the height change feature from ALS was 0.76 at stand level. Correspondingly, the correlation between the InSAR mean height change and the ALS penetration rate change was 0.89. The AGB changes predicted based on InSAR height change agreed well with the reference data; the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 20.7 Mg/ha (18.5% of the mean biomass in 2012) at stand level and 27.4 Mg/ha (27.0%) for 16 x 16 m grid cells. The results show that TDX DSMs can be used to detect biomass changes of different orders of magnitude, e.g. due to logging and thinning.

Large-area mapping of Canadian boreal forest cover, height, biomass and other structural attributes using Landsat composites and lidar plots	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the similar to 552 million ha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a > 25,000 km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on > 80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.

The airborne lidar is used to link ground observations of AGB to space lidar measurements. Two sets of models are generated, the first relating ground estimates of AGB to airborne laser scanning (ALS) measurements and the second set relating ALS estimates of AGB (generated using the first model set) to GLAS measurements. GLAS then, is used as a sampling tool within a hybrid estimation framework to generate stratum-, state-, and national-level AGB estimates. A two-phase variance estimator is employed to quantify GLAS sampling variability and, additively, ALS-GLAS model variability in this current, three-phase (ground-ALS-space lidar) study. The model variance component characterizes the variability of the regression coefficients used to predict ALS-based estimates of biomass as a function of GLAS measurements. Three different types of predictive models are considered in CONUS to determine which produced biomass totals closest to ground-based national forest inventory estimates - (1) linear (LIN), (2) linear-no-intercept (LNI), and (3) log-linear. For CONUS at the national level, the GLAS LNI model estimate (23.95 +/- 0.45 Gt AGB), agreed most closely with the US national forest inventory ground estimate, 24.17 +/- 0.06 Gt, i.e., within 1%. The national biomass total based on linear ground-ALS and ALS-GLAS models (25.87 +/- 0.49 Gt) overestimated the national ground-based estimate by 7.5%. The comparable log -linear model result (63.29 +/- 1.36 Gt) overestimated ground results by 261%. All three national biomass GLAS estimates, LIN, LNI, and log -linear, are based on 241,718 pulses collected on 230 orbits. The US national forest inventory (ground) estimates are based on 119,414 ground plots. At the US state level, the average absolute value of the deviation of LNI GLAS estimates from the comparable ground estimate of total biomass was 18.8% (range: Oregon, -40.8% to North Dakota, 128.6%). Log-linear models produced gross overestimates in the continental US, i.e., >2.6x, and the use of this model to predict regional biomass using GLAS data in temperate, western hemisphere forests is not appropriate. The best model form, LNI, is used to produce biomass estimates in Mexico. The average biomass density in Mexican forests is 53.10 +/- 0.88 t/ha, and the total biomass for the country, given a total forest area of 688,096 km(2), is 3.65 +/- 0.06 Gt. In Mexico, our GLAS biomass total underestimated a 2005 FAO estimate (4.152 Gt) by 12% and overestimated a 2007/8 radar study's figure (3.06 Gt) by 19%.

J	Abdullahi, S; Kugler, F; Pretzsch, H				Abdullahi, Sahra; Kugler, Florian; Pretzsch, Hans			Prediction of stem volume in complex temperate forest stands using TanDEM-X SAR data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Reliable estimations of stem volume are important for sustainable forest management planning as well as for monitoring of global changes. However, the derivation of stem volume in cubic meters per hectare based on traditional sampling-based forest inventories (usually with a repetition rate of ten years) is very expensive, labor-intensive and only available for the minority of the forest areas worldwide. Thus, spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can provide estimations of forest parameters with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for large areas. Height information extracted from two interferometric dual-polarized TanDEM-X data sets were used to investigate the potential of polarimetric interferometric X-band SAR data for stem volume estimation in the complex forest stands of the Traunstein forest in Southeast Bavaria, Germany. In contrast to other studies of forest parameter estimation from X-band SAR data carried out in boreal or tropical forest stands, the current study investigated stem volume estimation based on X-band SAR data in complex temperate forest stands. A linear regression model based on the allometric relationship of forest height (estimated from SAR data combined with an airborne LiDAR-based Digital Terrain Model) and stem volume per unit area (deduced from traditional forest inventory) was derived. Moreover, the model was extended and thus improved by integrating novel parameters derived from the co-occurrence matrix as surrogates for horizontal forest structure. This linear regression model predicted stem volume at plot (circular plots of 500 m(2)) level with a coefficient of determination of R-2 = 69% and a root mean square error of RMSE = 155 m(3) ha(-1) and stand (areas of 1.5 to 6.4 ha) level with R-2 = 94% and RMSE = 44 m(3) ha(-1) respectively.

L.; Packalen, Petteri; Valbuena, Ruben			Determining maximum entropy in 3D remote sensing height distributions and using it to improve aboveground biomass modelling via stratification	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												McArthur's foliage height diversity (FHD) has been the gold standard in the determination of structural complexity of forests characterized by LiDAR vertical height profiles. It is based on Shannon's entropy index, which was originally designed to describe evenness in abundances among qualitative typologies, and thus the calculation of FHD involves subjective layering steps which are essentially unnatural to describe a continuous variable (X) such as height. In this contribution we aim to provide a mathematical framework for determining maximum entropy in 3D remote sensing datasets based on the Gini Coefficient of theoretical continuous distributions, intended to replace FHD as entropy measure in vertical profiles of LiDAR heights (1D, X), with extensions to variables expressing dimensions of higher order (2D or 3D, Z proportional to X2 or X3). Then we apply this framework to Boreal forests in Finland to describe landscape heterogeneity with the intention to improve the modelling of forest aboveground biomass (AGB), hypothesizing that LiDAR models of AGB should essentially be different in areas of differing structural characteristics. We carried out a pre-stratification of LiDAR data collected in 2012 using simple rules applied to the L-skewness (Lskew) and L-coefficient of variation of LiDAR echo heights (Lcv; equivalent to the Gini coefficient, GCH), determining a new threshold at GCH = 0.33 as a consequence of the newly developed mathematical proofs. We observed only moderate improvements in terms of model accuracies: RMSDs reduced from 41.7% to 38.9 or 37.0%. More remarkably, we identified critical differences in the metrics selected at each stratum, which is useful to understand what predictor variables are more important for estimating AGB at each area of a forest. We observed that higher LiDAR height percentiles are more relevant at open canopies and heterogeneous forests, whereas closed canopies in homogeneous forests obtain most accurate predictions from a combination of cover metrics and percentiles around the median. Without stratification, the overall model would neglect explained variability in the structural types of lower occurrence, and predictions from a model influenced by structural types of higher occurrence would be biased at those areas. These results are thus useful in terms of improving our understanding on the relationships underlying LiDAR-AGB models.					; Adnan, Syed/L-5758-2015; Mehtätalo, Lauri/E-3960-2013; Valbuena, Ruben/I-6127-2019	Ammaturo, Rhei/0000-0001-5125-0139; Packalen, Petteri/0000-0003-1804-0011; Adnan, Syed/0000-0003-3973-4776; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				JUL	2021	260								112464	10.1016/j.rse.2021.112464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112464		APR 2021											WOS:000663143600007

Biomass estimation in a boreal forest from TanDEM-X data, lidar DTM, and the interferometric water cloud model	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The semi-empirical Interferometric Water Cloud Model, IWCM, is used to estimate above ground forest biomass, AGB, in northern Sweden, Krycklan (64 degrees N 20 degrees E). The results are based on separate analysis of 14 TanDEM-X ac-quisitions from 2011 to 2014 and a Lidar digital terrain model (DTM). 29 stands covering 272 ha and with AGB < 183 Mg/ha, and 619 stands with area > 1 ha covering 3166 ha and with AGB < 291Mg/ ha have been analyzed. In situ and airborne lidar scanning, ALS, data from the BioSAR 2008 experiment are used as reference. AGB and forest height are estimated using a new optimization method for determining IWCM parameters. Allometric equations are used to describe the inter-dependency between forest height, biomass, area-fill factor, and stem volume. No local training data from the investigated area are used to determine model parameters. For the 29 stands, the relative RMSE for biomass estimated using the proposed method varied between 15.8% and 21.2% (r(2) between 0.82 and 0.88) and between 9.9% and 16.0% for height (r(2) between 0.84 and 0.89). Dependence of model parameters on temperature and precipitation as well as height of ambiguity are investigated. A method based on look-up table for biomass estimation from phase height is proposed. The method is used over an area of 68 km(2) for one TanDEM-X acquisition from 2011-06-04 and the results are compared with an ALS biomass map from August 2008. Good agreement is observed, as well as high potential for clear-cut detection. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Estimation of aboveground forest biomass in Galicia (NW Spain) by the combined use of LiDAR, LANDSAT ETM plus and National Forest Inventory data	IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY												Assessing biomass is critical for accounting bioenergy potentials and monitoring forest ecosystem responses to global change and disturbances. Remote sensing, especially Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data combined with field data, is being increasingly used for forest inventory purposes. We evaluated the feasibility of the combined use of freely available data, both remote sensing (LiDAR data provided by the Spanish National Plan for Aerial Ortophotography - PNOA - and Landsat vegetation spectral indices) and field data (from the National Forest Inventory) to estimate stand dendrometric and above-ground biomass variables of the most productive tree species in a pilot area in Galicia (northwestern Spain). The results suggest that the models can accurately predict dendrometric and biomass variables at plot level with an R-2 ranging from 0.49 to 0.65 for basal area, from 0.65 to 0.95 for dominant height, from 0.48 to 0.68 for crown biomass and from 0.55 to 0.82 for stem biomass. Our results support the use of this approach to reduce the cost of forest inventories and provide a useful tool for stakeholders to map forest stand variables and biomass stocks.

Lidar is considered the premier instrument to estimate above ground biomass, but data are expensive and collected on-demand, with limited spatial and temporal coverage. The previous JERS and ALOS SAR satellites data were extensively employed to model forest biomass, with literature suggesting signal saturation at low-moderate biomass values, and an influence of plot size on estimates accuracy. The ALOS2 continuity mission since May 2014 produces data with improved features with respect to the former ALOS, such as increased spatial resolution and reduced revisit time. We used ALOS2 backscatter data, testing also the integration with additional features (SAR textures and NDVI from Landsat 8 data) together with ground truth, to model and map above ground biomass in two mixed forest sites: Tahoe (California) and Asiago (Alps). While texture was useful to improve the model performance, the best model was obtained using joined SAR and NDVI (R-2 equal to 0.66). In this model, only a slight saturation was observed, at higher levels than what usually reported in literature for SAR; the trend requires further investigation but the model confirmed the complementarity of optical and SAR datatypes. For comparison purposes, we also generated a biomass map for Asiago using lidar data, and considered a previous lidar-based study for Tahoe; in these areas, the observed R-2 were 0.92 for Tahoe and 0.75 for Asiago, respectively. The quantitative comparison of the carbon stocks obtained with the two methods allows discussion of sensor suitability. The range of local variation captured by lidar is higher than those by SAR and NDVI, with the latter showing overestimation. However, this overestimation is very limited for one of the study areas, suggesting that when the purpose is the overall quantification of the stored carbon, especially in areas with high carbon density, satellite data with lower cost and broad coverage can be as effective as lidar.

However, climate-induced disturbances such as fires, windthrows, droughts, and pest outbreaks underscore the need for stronger forest monitoring systems. National Forest Inventories (NFIs) serve as the primary source of forest data and information in Europe. Yet, inconsistencies in timing, coverage, methodologies, and data quality highlight the need for a more harmonized and spatially detailed approach. Critically, predicting forest variables directly from satellite data remains challenging, mainly due to the difficulties in aligning remote sensing with ground data. Meanwhile, the operational use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is limited by high costs, infrequent updates, and inconsistent coverage from different sensors and flight conditions. This study presents a novel approach relying on fully connected neural networks to integrate Landsat satellite time series and forest disturbance and recovery metrics with ALS data to predict forest height metrics, which can then be used to accurately predict critical forest variables, such as growing stock volume (GSV) and stand basal area (BA). The method was tested across five ecologically and geographically diverse European forest regions: Tuscany (Italy), the Netherlands, the Canton of Grisons (Switzerland), Bia & lstrok;owiez(center dot)a Forest (Poland), and the Vindela<spacing diaeresis>lven-Juhttatahkka Biosphere Reserve (Sweden). ALS forest height metrics were predicted with R2 values ranging from 0.47 to 0.68. Then, based on field data, forest height metrics were used to predict GSV (R2 = 0.78) and BA (R2 = 0.69). Our method addresses the issue of limited spatial and temporal availability of ALS data by predicting ALSderived height metrics using Landsat time series. This study examines the challenges of combining satellite and NFI data, building on the premise that satellite data can be effectively used to predict forest height metrics derived from ALS, which in turn can be used to accurately quantify several forest variables. The methods presented here support scalable and cost-effective forest monitoring by providing the spatially and temporally detailed information needed to implement climate-smart forestry.

In this study, we sought to assess the potential and merit of multi-temporal dual-polarised L-band observations for vegetation height estimation in tropical deciduous and evergreen forests of Mexico. We estimated vegetation height using dual-polarised L-band observations and a machine learning approach. We used airborne LiDAR-based vegetation height for model training and for result validation. We split LiDAR-based vegetation height into training and test data using two different approaches, i.e., considering and ignoring spatial autocorrelation between training and test data. Our results indicate that ignoring spatial autocorrelation leads to an overoptimistic model's predictive performance. Accordingly, a spatial splitting of the reference data should be preferred in order to provide realistic retrieval accuracies. Moreover, the model's predictive performance increases with an increasing number of spatial predictors and training samples, but saturates at a specific level (i.e., at 12 dual-polarised L-band backscatter measurements and at around 20% of all training samples). In consideration of spatial autocorrelation between training and test data, we determined an optimal number of L-band observations and training samples as a trade-off between retrieval accuracy and data collection effort. In summary, our study demonstrates the merit of multi-temporal ScanSAR L-band observations for estimation of vegetation height at a larger scale and provides a workflow for robust predictions of this parameter.

Evaluating Site-Specific and Generic Spatial Models of Aboveground Forest Biomass Based on Landsat Time-Series and LiDAR Strip Samples in the Eastern USA	REMOTE SENSING												Large-area assessment of aboveground tree biomass (AGB) to inform regional or national forest monitoring programs can be efficiently carried out by combining remotely sensed data and field sample measurements through a generic statistical model, in contrast to site-specific models. We integrated forest inventory plot data with spatial predictors from Landsat time-series imagery and LiDAR strip samples at four sites across the eastern USAMinnesota (MN), Maine (ME), Pennsylvania-New Jersey (PANJ) and South Carolina (SC)in statistical modeling frameworks to analyze the performance of generic (all sites combined) versus site-specific models. The major objective was to evaluate the prediction accuracy of generic and site-specific models when applied to particular sites. Pixel-level polynomial model fitting was applied to the time-series of near-anniversary date Landsat variables to obtain projected metrics in the target year 2014 for which LiDAR strip samples were available. Two forms of models based on ordinary least-squares multiple linear regressions (MLR) and the random forest (RF) machine learning approach were developed for each site and for the pooled (i.e., generic) reference data frame. The models were evaluated using national forest inventory (NFI) data for the USA. We observed stronger fit statistics with the MLR than with RF for both the site-specific and the generic models. The proportions of variances explained (adjusted R-2) with the site-specific models were 0.86, 0.78, 0.82 and 0.92 for ME, MN, PANJ and SC, respectively while the generic model had adjusted R-2 = 0.85. A test of statistical equivalence of observed and predicted AGB for the NFI locations did not reveal equivalence with any of the models, possibly due to the different resolutions of the observed and predicted data. In contrast, predictions by the generic and site-specific models were equivalent. We conclude that a generic model provides accuracies comparable to the site-specific models for large-area AGB assessment across our study sites in the eastern USA.

Recent years have seen an increased emphasis on the use of active sensors like Radar and airborne LiDAR (light detection and scanning) systems to estimate various 3D characteristics of canopy and crown structure that can be used as predictors of biomass. However, airborne LiDAR data are expensive to acquire, and not often readily available across large remote landscapes. In this study, we evaluated the potential of stereo imagery from commercially available Very High Resolution (VHR) satellites as an alternative for estimating canopy height variables in Australian tropical savannas, using a semi-global dense matching (SGM) image-based technique. We assessed and compared the completeness and vertical accuracy of extracted canopy height models (CHMs) from GeoEye 1 and WorldView 1 VHR satellite stereo pairs and summarised the factors influencing image matching effectiveness and quality. Our results showed that stereo dense matching using the SGM technique severely underestimates tree presence and canopy height. The highest tree detection rates were achieved by using the near-infrared (NIR) band of GEl (8-9%). WV1-GE1 cross-satellite (mixed) models did not improve the quality of extracted canopy heights. We consider these poor detection rates and height retrievals to result from: i) the clumping crown structure of the dominant Eucalyptus spp.; ii) their vertically oriented leaves (affecting the bidirectional reflectance distribution function); iii) image band radiometry and iv) wind induced crown movement affecting stereo-pair point matching. Our detailed analyses suggest that current commercially available VHR satellite data (0.5 m resolution) are not well suited to estimating canopy height variables, and therefore above ground biomass (AGB), in Eucalyptus dominated north Australian tropical savanna woodlands.

The primary objective of this study was to predict forest height on sloping terrain over large areas with the Geometric-Optical Model for Sloping Terrains (COST) using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and Landsat 7 imagery in the western Greater Khingan Mountains of China. The Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone (SMACC) algorithm was used to generate image end members and corresponding abundances in Landsat imagery. Then, LiDAR-derived forest metrics, topographical factors and SMACC abundances were used to calibrate and validate the COST, which aimed to accurately decompose the SMACC mixed forest pixels into sunlit crown, sunlit background and shade components. Finally, the forest height of the study area was retrieved based on a back-propagation neural network and a look-up table. Results showed good performance for coniferous forests on all slopes and at all aspects, with significant coefficients of determination above 0.70 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 0.50 m and 1.00 m based on ground observed validation data. Higher RMSEs were found in areas with forest heights below 5 m and above 17 m. For 90% of the forested area, the average RMSE was 3.58 m. Our study demonstrates the tremendous potential of the COST for quantitative mapping of forest height on sloping terrains with multispectral and LiDAR inputs.

Global and biome-scale impacts are mediated by burn severity, measured as loss of forest canopy and consumption of the soil organic layer. To date, knowledge of the spatial variability in burn severity has been limited by sparse field sampling and moderate resolution satellite data. Here, we used pre- and post-fire airborne lidar data to directly estimate changes in canopy vertical structure and surface elevation for a 2005 boreal forest fire on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. We found that both canopy and surface losses were strongly linked to pre-fire species composition and exhibited important fine-scale spatial variability at sub-30m resolution. The fractional reduction in canopy volume ranged from 0.61 in lowland black spruce stands to 0.27 in mixed white spruce and broadleaf forest. Residual structure largely reflects standing dead trees, highlighting the influence of pre-fire forest structure on delayed carbon losses from aboveground biomass, post-fire albedo, and variability in understory light environments. Median loss of surface elevation was highest in lowland black spruce stands (0.18 m) but much lower in mixed stands (0.02 m), consistent with differences in pre-fire organic layer accumulation. Spatially continuous depth-of-burn estimates from repeat lidar measurements provide novel information to constrain carbon emissions from the surface organic layer and may inform related research on post-fire successional trajectories. Spectral measures of burn severity from Landsat were correlated with canopy (r = 0.76) and surface (r = -0.71) removal in black spruce stands but captured less of the spatial variability in fire effects for mixed stands (canopy r = 0.56, surface r = -0.26), underscoring the difficulty in capturing fire effects in heterogeneous boreal forest landscapes using proxy measures of burn severity from Landsat.

Crop Monitoring Using Satellite/UAV Data Fusion and Machine Learning	REMOTE SENSING												Non-destructive crop monitoring over large areas with high efficiency is of great significance in precision agriculture and plant phenotyping, as well as decision making with regards to grain policy and food security. The goal of this research was to assess the potential of combining canopy spectral information with canopy structure features for crop monitoring using satellite/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data fusion and machine learning. Worldview-2/3 satellite data were tasked synchronized with high-resolution RGB image collection using an inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at a heterogeneous soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) field. Canopy spectral information (i.e., vegetation indices) was extracted from Worldview-2/3 data, and canopy structure information (i.e., canopy height and canopy cover) was derived from UAV RGB imagery. Canopy spectral and structure information and their combination were used to predict soybean leaf area index (LAI), aboveground biomass (AGB), and leaf nitrogen concentration (N) using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and extreme learning regression (ELR) with a newly proposed activation function. The results revealed that: (1) UAV imagery-derived high-resolution and detailed canopy structure features, canopy height, and canopy coverage were significant indicators for crop growth monitoring, (2) integration of satellite imagery-based rich canopy spectral information with UAV-derived canopy structural features using machine learning improved soybean AGB, LAI, and leaf N estimation on using satellite or UAV data alone, (3) adding canopy structure information to spectral features reduced background soil effect and asymptotic saturation issue to some extent and led to better model performance, (4) the ELR model with the newly proposed activated function slightly outperformed PLSR, RFR, and SVR in the prediction of AGB and LAI, while RFR provided the best result for N estimation. This study introduced opportunities and limitations of satellite/UAV data fusion using machine learning in the context of crop monitoring.					; Paheding, Sidike/O-5094-2019	Maimaitijiang, Maitiniyazi/0000-0001-6153-1583; Sagan, Vasit/0000-0003-4375-2096														2072-4292				MAY	2020	12	9							1357	10.3390/rs12091357	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12091357													WOS:000543394000004

This study aimed to estimate temperate forest CC and AGB by integrating airborne LiDAR data with wall-to-wall space-borne SPOT-6 data through geostatistical modeling. Our study involved the following approach: (1) reference maps of CC and AGB were derived from wall-to-wall LiDAR data and calibrated by field measurements; (2) twelve discrete LiDAR flights were simulated by assuming that LiDAR data were only available beneath these flights; (3) training/testing samples of CC and AGB were extracted from the reference maps inside and outside the simulated flights using stratified random sampling; (4) The simple linear regression, ordinary kriging and regression kriging model were used to extend the sparsely sampled CC/AGB data to the entire study area by incorporating a selection of SPOT-6 variables, including vegetation indices and texture variables. The regression kriging model was superior at estimating and mapping the spatial distribution of CC and AGB, as it featured the lowest mean absolute error (MAE; 11.295% and 18.929 t/ha for CC and AGB, respectively) and root mean squared error (RMSE; 17.361% and 21.351 t/ha for CC and AGB, respectively). The predicted and reference values of both CC and AGB were highly correlated for the entire study area based on the estimation histograms and error maps. Finally, we concluded that the regression kriging model was superior and more effective at estimating LiDAR-derived CC and AGB values using the spatially-reduced samples and the SPOT-6 variables. The presented modeling workflow will greatly facilitate future forest growth monitoring and carbon stock assessments for large areas of temperate forest in northeast China. It also provides guidance on how to take full advantage of future sparsely collected LiDAR data in cases where wall-to-wall LiDAR coverage is not available from the perspective of geostatistics.

Additionally, estimation of forest structural attributes, such as aboveground biomass (AGBM), is an important step in identifying the amount of carbon in terrestrial vegetation pools and is central to global carbon cycle studies. Although current remote sensing techniques recover such tropical forest structure poorly, new large-footprint lidar instruments show great promise. As part of a prelaunch validation plan for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission, the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS), a large-footprint airborne scanning lidar, was flown over the La Selva Biological Station, a tropical wet forest site in Costa Rica. The primary objective of this study was to test the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to recover forest structural characteristics across a spectrum of land cover types from pasture to secondary and primary tropical forests. LVIS metrics were able to predict field-derived quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD), basal area, and AGBM with R 2 values of up to .93,.72, and .93, respectively. These relationships were significant and nonasymptotic through the entire range of conditions sampled at the La Selva. Our results confirm the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments. to estimate. important structural attributes, including biomass in dense tropical forests, and when taken along with similar results from studies in temperate forests, strongly validate the VCL mission framework.

J	Zhou, XC; Wang, WJ; Di, LP; Lu, L; Guo, LY				Zhou, Xiaocheng; Wang, Wenjun; Di, Liping; Lu, Lin; Guo, Liying			Estimation of Tree Height by Combining Low Density Airborne LiDAR Data and Images Using the 3D Tree Model: A Case Study in a Subtropical Forest in China	FORESTS												In general, low density airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data are typically used to obtain the average height of forest trees. If the data could be used to obtain the tree height at the single tree level, it would greatly extend the usage of the data. Since the tree top position is often missed by the low density LiDAR pulse point, the estimated forest tree height at the single tree level is generally lower than the actual tree height when low density LiDAR data are used for the estimation. To resolve this problem, in this paper, a modified approach based on three-dimensional (3D) parameter tree model was adopted to reconstruct the tree height at the single tree level by combining the characteristics of high resolution remote sensing images and low density airborne LiDAR data. The approach was applied to two coniferous forest plots in the subtropical forest region, Fujian Province, China. The following conclusions were reached after analyzing the results: The marker-controlled watershed segmentation method is able to effectively extract the crown profile from sub meter-level resolution images without the aid of the height information of LiDAR data. The adaptive local maximum method satisfies the need for detecting the vertex of a single tree crown. The improved following-valley approach is available for estimating the tree crown diameter. The 3D parameter tree model, which can take advantage of low-density airborne LiDAR data and high resolution images, is feasible for improving the estimation accuracy of the tree height. Compared to the tree height results from only using the low density LiDAR data, this approach can achieve higher estimation accuracy. The accuracy of the tree height estimation at the single tree level for two test areas was more than 80%, and the average estimation error of the tree height was 0.7 m. The modified approach based on the three-dimensional parameter tree model can effectively increase the estimation accuracy of individual tree height by combining the characteristics of high resolution remote sensing images and low density airborne LiDAR data.

Between 2004 and 2007, the Mexican National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) established a network of similar to 26,000 permanent inventory plots in the frame of their national inventory program, the Inventario Nacional Forestal y de Suelos (INFyS). INFyS data served as model response for spatially extending the field-based estimates of carbon stored in the aboveground live dry biomass to a wall-to-wall map, with 30 x 30 m(2) pixel posting using canopy density estimates derived from Landsat, L-Band radar data from ALOS PALSAR, as well as elevation information derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data set. Validation against an independent set of INFyS plots resulted in a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.5 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14 t.C/ha in the case of flat terrain. The validation for different forest types showed a consistently low estimation bias (<3 t.C/ha) and R(2)s in the range of 0.5 except for mangroves (R-2 = 0.2). Lower accuracies were achieved for forests located on steep slopes (>15 degrees) with an R-2 of 0.34. A comparison of the average carbon stocks computed from: (a) the map; and (b) statistical estimates from INFyS, at the scale of similar to 650 km(2) large hexagons (R-2 of 0.78, RMSE of 5 t.C/ha) and Mexican states (R-2 of 0.98, RMSE of 1.4 t.C/ha), showed strong agreement.

Active sensor systems, such as lidar, can generate detailed canopy height products. Relationships between canopy height and biomass are commonly established via regression analysis using information from ground-truth plots. In this way, many site-specific height-biomass relationships have been proposed in the literature and applied for mapping in regional contexts. However, such relationships are only valid within the specific forest type for which they were calibrated. A generalized relationship would facilitate biomass estimation across forest types and regions. In this study, a combination of lidar-derived and ancillary structural descriptors is proposed as an approach for generalization between forest types. Each descriptor is supposed to quantify a different aspect of forest structure, i.e., mean canopy height, maximum canopy height, maximum stand density, vertical heterogeneity and wood density. Airborne discrete return lidar data covering 194 ha of forest inventory plots from five different sites including temperate and tropical forests from Africa, Europe, North, Central and South America was used. Biomass predictions using the best general model (nRMSE = 12.4%, R-2 = 0.74) were found to be almost as accurate as predictions using five site-specific models (nRMSE = 11.6%, R-2 = 0.78). The results further allow interpretation about the importance of the employed structure descriptors in the biomass estimation and the mechanisms behind the relationships. Understanding the relationship between canopy structure and aboveground biomass and being able to generalize it across forest types are important steps towards consistent large scale biomass mapping and monitoring using airborne and potentially also spaceborne platforms.					; Fischer, Rico/AAI-4543-2021; Cazcarra-Bes, Victor/ODM-0175-2025	Knapp, Nikolai/0000-0001-5065-9979; Cazcarra-Bes, Victor/0000-0002-6776-4553; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	2020	237								111597	10.1016/j.rse.2019.111597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111597													WOS:000509819300043

The framework was implemented to scale up forest attribute models from field data to intersecting airborne LiDAR data, and then to GLAS footprints. GLAS data were sequentially filtered and submitted to the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) imputation algorithm to yield regional estimates of stand height and crown closure at a 30 m resolution. Resulting outputs were assessed against independent airborne LiDAR data to evaluate regional estimates of stand height (mean difference = -1 m, RMSE = 5 m) and crown closure (mean difference = -5%, RMSE = 9%). Additional assessments were performed as a function of dominant vegetation type and ecoregion to further evaluate regional products. These attributes form the primary descriptive structure attributes that are typical of forest inventory mapping programs, and provide insight into how they can be derived in northern boreal regions where field information and physical access is often limited.					; Chen, Qi/N-7930-2016	hopkinson, chris/0000-0002-3998-4778; Filiatrault, Michelle/0000-0001-9942-2390; Chen, Qi/0000-0003-0110-7996														2072-4292				SEP	2018	10	9							1338	10.3390/rs10091338	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10091338													WOS:000449993800018

Therefore, the potential of a globally available TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) was investigated for aboveground biomass estimation via canopy height models (CHMs) in a tropical peat swamp forest. However, CHMs based on X-band interferometers usually require external terrain models. High accurate terrain models are not available on global scale. Therefore, an approach exclusively based on TanDEM-X and the decrease of accuracy compared to an approach utilizing a high accurate terrain model is assessed. In addition, the potential of X-band interferometric heights in tropical forests needs to be evaluated. Therefore, two CHMs were derived from an intermediate TanDEM-X DEM (iDEM; as a precursor for WorldDEM(TM)) alone and in combination with lidar measurements used as terrain model. The analysis showed high accuracies (root mean square error [RMSE]=5m) for CHMs based on iDEM and reliable estimation of aboveground biomass. The iDEM CHM, exclusively based on TanDEM-X, achieved a poor R-2 of 0.2, nonetheless resulted in a cross-validated RMSE of 54 tha(-1) (16%). The low R-2 suggested that the X-band height alone was not sufficient to estimate an accurate CHM, and thus the need for external terrain models was confirmed. A CHM retrieved from the difference of iDEM and an accurate lidar terrain model achieved a considerably higher correlation with aboveground biomass (R-2=0.68) and low cross-validated RMSE of 24.5 tha(-1) (7.5%). This was higher or comparable to other aboveground biomass estimations in tropical peat swamp forests. The potential of X-band interferometric heights for CHM and biomass estimation was thus confirmed in tropical forest in addition to existing knowledge in boreal forests.					; Böhm, Hans/AAQ-6837-2020	Schlund, Michael/0000-0001-6657-6713; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				NOV	2016	37	21					5021	5044		10.1080/01431161.2016.1226001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2016.1226001													WOS:000384692500001

Unlike the forest inventory attributes (e.g., tree height and diameter at breast height), the relative ability of DAP and ALS in predicting canopy structural variables (i.e., canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI)) has not been sufficiently investigated by previous studies. In this study, we comprehensively compared the canopy cover and LAI estimates using DAP- and ALS-based methods over 166 selected tropical forest sample plots with seven different tree species and forest types. We also explored the relationship between field-measured aboveground biomass (AGB) and the LAI estimates. The airborne LAI estimates were subsequently compared with the Sentinel-2-based LAI values that were retrieved using a one-dimensional radiative transfer model. The results demonstrated that the DAP-based method generally overestimated the two canopy variables compared to ALS-based methods but with relatively high correlations regardless of forest type and species (R-2 of 0.80 for canopy cover and R-2 of 0.76 for LAI). Under different forest types and species, the R-2 of canopy cover and LAI range from 0.64 to 0.89 and from 0.54 to 0.87, respectively. Apparently, different correlations between AGB and LAI were found for different forest types and species where the mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest shows the best correlation with R-2 larger than 0.70 for both methods. The comparison with satellite retrievals verified that the ALS-based estimates are more consistent with Sentinel-2-based estimates than DAP-based estimates. We concluded that DAP data failed to provide analogous results to ALS data for canopy variable estimation in tropical forests.					li, chenyun/HHM-7239-2022; zheng, yanfeng/H-4233-2013															2076-3417				OCT	2022	12	19							9882	10.3390/app12199882	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12199882													WOS:000866614200001

Presently, the TanDEM-X mission possesses the capability to collect global-scale InSAR data at high spatial resolution, enabling the generation of a high-resolution global DEM (12 m). Nevertheless, directly utilizing InSAR data poses challenges in detecting sub-canopy topography within forest areas, due to the presence of volume scattering and limited penetration of X-band. Conversely, the upcoming BIOMASS mission operated in P-band will provide an exceptional opportunity for sub-canopy topography extraction, owing to its strong penetration and the capability to collect fully-polarimetric SAR data. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that BIOMASS data do have its own limitation, manifesting as lower resolution (100 m) due to limited bandwidth. To address these challenges and generate high-resolution sub-canopy topography, we propose a new method that leverages the strengths of both TanDEM-X InSAR and BIOMASS PolInSAR datasets through the wavelet transform. We evaluated the performance of our method at two test sites characterized by different forest types and terrain conditions using airborne LiDAR data. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in sub-canopy topography accuracy. Specifically, under the boreal coniferous forest scenario, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the resulting sub-canopy topography decreased by 44% compared to the TanDEM-X InSAR DEM. In tropical broadleaf forest scenario, the RMSE reduction reached 64% over the TanDEM-X InSAR DEM. These results indicate the potential of our approach for high-resolution sub-canopy topography mapping by combing data from these two different spaceborne SAR sensors.

Integrating airborne LiDAR and space-borne radar via multivariate kriging to estimate above-ground biomass	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Understanding and investigating synergies between LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and SAR (synthetic aperture radar) provide new and innovative opportunities to characterize above-ground biomass. We demonstrate a spatial modeling framework that integrates above-ground biomass transects, derived from plot-based field data and small-footprint discrete return LiDAR, with complete wall-to-wall spaceborne L-band and C-band SAR to predict biomass over a larger area. Transect intervals of 2000 m, 1000 m, and 500 m were tested. Co-kriging, regression kriging, and regression co-kriging were used to extend the LiDAR-derived biomass transects. LiDAR-derived above-ground biomass and L-band backscatter (HV polarization) were moderately correlated, with a maximum semivariance distance between the LiDAR-derived biomass and SAR data of 374 m. Regression kriging at a sample interval of 500 m showed the smallest root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) at 203.9 Mg ha(-1) and 131.6 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The mean error (ME) showed an average bias of -14.0 Mg ha(-1). Predictions using regression co-kriging at a sample interval of 2000 m resulted in the highest RMSE and MAE values at 2382 Mg ha(-1) and 164.6 Mg ha(-1), respectively. ME also was highest, averaging - 37.4 Mg ha(-1). Regardless of the spatial modeling technique employed, lower errors in predicted above-ground biomass were associated with smaller transect intervals. Moderate correlations between the LiDAR-derived above-ground biomass and the radar data impacted the predictive accuracy of the spatial models; however, overall variation in above-ground biomass in the study area was well represented. This study demonstrated that a sampling framework integrating LiDAR data with space-borne radar data using a spatial modeling approach can provide spatially-explicit above-ground biomass estimates for large areas. Such a sampling framework can be used in combination with ground plot and land cover data to assess carbon stocks under conditions where more common optical remote sensing approaches are difficult to implement.

The full-waveform spaceborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) provides great possibilities for large-scale and long-term biomass estimation. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing research has utilized average tree height (or height metrics) within a GLAS footprint as the key parameter for biomass estimation. However, the vertical distribution of tree height is usually not as homogeneous as we would expect within such a large footprint of more than 2000 m(2), which would limit the biomass estimation accuracy vastly. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel canopy height layering biomass estimation model (CHL-BEM) with GLAS data in this study. First, all the trees with similar height were regarded as one canopy layer within each GLAS footprint. Second, the canopy height and canopy cover of each layer were derived from GLAS waveform parameters. These parameters were extracted using a waveform decomposition algorithm (refined Levenberg-Marquardt-RLM), which assumed that each decomposed vegetation signal corresponded to a particular canopy height layer. Third, the biomass estimation model (CHL-BEM) was established by using the canopy height and canopy cover of each height layer. Finally, the CHL-BEM was compared with two typical biomass estimation models of GLAS in the study site located in Ejina, China, where the dominant species was Populus euphratica. The results showed that the CHL-BEM presented good agreement with the field measurement biomass (R-2 = 0.741, RMSE = 0.487, %RMSE = 24.192) and achieved a significantly higher accuracy than the other two models. As a whole, we expect our method to advance all the full-waveform LiDAR development and applications, e.g., the newly launched Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI).					shi, chen/KEH-8339-2024; Zhong, Ruofei/O-5273-2019; Yin, Dameng/E-6303-2018	Shi, Chen/0009-0002-2347-2169; Xu, Ronglong/0000-0002-3495-8124; Gong, Huili/0000-0001-9829-1608; Yin, Dameng/0000-0001-9668-2744														2072-4292				JUN 2	2019	11	12							1446	10.3390/rs11121446	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11121446													WOS:000473794600052
J	Narine, LL; Johnson, B				Narine, Lana L.; Johnson, Blake			A spatially comprehensive canopy cover dataset derived from NASA's ice, cloud and land elevation satellite-2 (ICESat-2) for the state of Alabama, USA	DATA IN BRIEF												NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) has already demonstrated an extraordinary capability to assess forests, including providing measurements of canopy heights, and estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) and canopy cover. Despite these advancements, the application of the mission's data to deriving continuous estimates of canopy cover, as is fundamental parameter for assessing forest conditions, is not well-understood. Here, we present a statewide (135,760 km2) canopy cover dataset at a 30 m scale across mixed temperate forests of the southern United States (US), highlighting feasibility of applying ICESat-2 data for deriving canopy cover, and providing a basis for further upscaling. This dataset provides continuous estimates of canopy cover across forests in the state of Alabama, in the southern United States, for the year 2022. Non-forests were masked out of the final dataset, and canopy cover values within each 30 m pixel, range from 0 to 72 %. Only freely and openly available remote sensing data were used to generate this dataset. ICESat-2's along-track, vegetation product data were acquired and filtered to retain nighttime-only samples within classified forests, calibrated using reference canopy cover from airborne lidar data, and then extrapolated to achieve wall-to-wall coverage, using a Random Forests (RF) model. The mapped output represents a large-area ICESat-2-derived canopy cover product, highlighting applicability of ICESat-2 for canopy cover information and synergistic use with free and open space-based and other available ancillary products for this information.

Investigating the agreement between global canopy height maps and airborne Lidar derived height estimates over Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Carbon storage in forest aboveground biomass is a critical, yet difficult, component of the global carbon cycle to estimate. Canopy height, a key indicator of carbon storage, can be estimated from Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) waveforms collected by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Although globally distributed, GLAS does not provide spatially exhaustive coverage. Therefore, accurate methods of extrapolation are necessary to produce wall-to-wall global canopy height maps from these data. In this analysis, we compare two of these global GLAS-derived height products to canopy height estimates derived from 25 000 km of discrete return airborne Lidar data over Canada's boreal forests. We selected the 95th percentile of first return height from airborne Lidar as a measure of canopy height to relate against estimates from the global GLAS-derived products. The agreement between the global GLAS-derived products and airborne Lidar-derived height estimates varied between the two products (average ecozone RMSE = 3.9 and 7.4 m), demonstrating that differences in data selection, processing, and extrapolation can influence height estimates derived from GLAS data. Where large differences existed between the global GLAS-derived products and the airborne Lidar-derived height estimates, the GLAS-derived products tended to predict taller canopies. Removing GLAS waveforms on steep terrain appeared to be a superior approach to reducing errors in height estimates, as the global GLAS-derived product that filtered these waveforms was in closer agreement with airborne Lidar-derived height estimates in regions of rough terrain (RMSE = 3.2-8.5 m compared with 8.1-13.8 m). Differences in the spatial resolution of canopy height estimates, coupled with varying definitions of canopy height within each product, should be considered when interpreting the results of this analysis. Investigating the relationship between small-footprint Lidar data and published canopy height products can identify the approaches that lead to the most accurate estimates of aboveground biomass and can help determine why discrepancies in height estimates exist between various model approaches, data and underlying environmental conditions.

Integration of tree-ring data, Landsat time series, and ALS-derived topographic variables to quantify growth declines in black spruce	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Forest ecosystems and timber products are expected to play a determining role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. As the frequency and severity of natural disturbances increase, remote sensing technologies prove crucial for detecting and assessing the impact of natural disturbance on forest condition and productivity. Although satellite-based remote sensing is commonly used for measuring the extent and severity of standreplacing disturbances such as fire and harvest, capturing the effects of subtler, non-stand replacing disturbances (NSR) remains challenging. Studies based on the analysis of tree rings have yielded insights on the impact of such disturbances at a local scale, yet tools for estimating the compound impact of NSR disturbances on broader scales are lacking. The objective of this study was to use Landsat time series spectral reflectance information in conjunction with tree-ring data to generate spatially explicit estimates of growth declines attributable to NSR disturbances at a 30-meter resolution across black spruce-dominated stands in two managed boreal forests. Basal area increment (BAI) calculated from 1545 increment cores collected in 52 plots across the two study sites were used to assess the growth decline in each plot due to NSR disturbance events from drought and insect defoliation. Plots that experienced a severe growth decline were identified using a threshold (i.e., a decrease in BAI >= 23.7% between two consecutive 11-year periods) established after examining the historical variability in growth rates from the tree-ring data. Subsequently, a logistic regression model was developed to predict the probability of a plot sustaining a severe growth decline, using predictors from Landsat time series and topographic variables derived from airborne laser scanning data, achieving an accuracy of 79.2% after five-fold cross-validation. In a subsequent modelling step, plots that experienced severe declines in BAI were used to construct a linear model, predicting the magnitude of the decline in BAI attributed to NSR disturbances using predictors from Landsat time series, and resulting in a model with an R2 = 0.70 when using five-fold crossvalidation. Model predictions were then applied to black spruce-dominated stands at both study sites to estimate the impact of disturbances on forest productivity. Depending on the study site, between 22.6% and 57.6% of the analysis area had a predicted probability of severe growth decline > 50%. Within the most affected areas, the median decrease in annual BAI predicted using the OLS model was 95.3 and 64.4 mm2 yr 1, respectively, for the two study sites. This research demonstrates the utility of combining tree ring and Landsat data to assess the impact of non-stand-replacing disturbances on forest growth at the scale of a forest management unit that in turn could inform salvage and/or silvicultural interventions that enhance the resistance and resilience of vulnerable stands.					; White, Joanne/Z-1981-2019; MorinBernard, Alexandre/LFT-2772-2024; Coops, Nicholas/J-1543-2012	Morin-Bernard, Alexane/0000-0003-2782-8679; White, Joanne/0000-0003-4674-0373; Achim, Alexis/0000-0003-0118-1651; Coops, Nicholas/0000-0002-0151-9037													0378-1127	1872-7042				APR 1	2024	557								121765	10.1016/j.foreco.2024.121765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2024.121765		FEB 2024											WOS:001188631400001

LiDAR remote sensing has proven efficient and accurate for the fine-scale estimation of above-ground tree biomass (AGB) and carbon stocks in many ecosystems, but tropical savanna remain under studied. We utilized a two-phase LiDAR analysis procedure which integrates both individual tree detection (ITC) and area-based approaches (ABA) to better understand how the uncertainty of biomass estimation varies with scale. We used estimations from individual tree LiDAR measurements as training/reference data, and then applied these data to develop allometric equations related to LIDAR metrics. We found that LiDAR individual tree heights were strongly correlated with field-estimated AGB (R-2 = 0.754, RMSE = 90 kg), and that 63% of individual trees crowns (ITC) could be accurately delineated with a canopy maxima approach. Area-based biomass estimation (ABA), which incorporated errors from the ITC steps, identified the quadratic mean of canopy height (QMCH) as the best single independent variable for different plot sample sizes (e.g. for 4 ha plots: R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.4 Mg ha(-1); and 1 ha plots: R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 4.0 Mg ha(-1)). Our results show how ITC and ABA approached can be integrated to understand how biomass uncertainty varies with scale across broad landscapes. Understanding these scaling relationships is critical for operationalizing regional savanna inventories, monitoring and mapping.

Such approaches allow the size, growth, and mortality of individual trees to be measured, enabling forest carbon stocks and dynamics to be tracked and understood. Many algorithms exist for structurally simple forests, including coniferous forests and plantations. Finding a robust solution for structurally complex, species-rich tropical forests remains a challenge; existing segmentation algorithms often perform less well than simple area-based approaches when estimating plot-level biomass. Here, we describe a multiclass graph cut (MCGC) approach to tree crown delineation. This uses local 3D geometry and density information, alongside knowledge of crown allometries, to segment ITCs from airborne light detection and ranging point clouds. Our approach robustly identifies trees in the top and intermediate layers of the canopy, but cannot recognize small trees. From these 3D crowns, we are able to measure individual tree biomass. Comparing these estimates with those from permanent inventory plots, our algorithm can produce robust estimates of hectare-scale carbon density, demonstrating the power of ITC approaches in monitoring forests. The flexibility of our method to add additional dimensions of information, such as spectral reflectance, make this approach an obvious avenue for future development and extension to other sources of 3D data, such as structure from motion data sets.

J	Wilkes, P; Disney, M; Vicari, MB; Calders, K; Burt, A				Wilkes, Phil; Disney, Mathias; Vicari, Matheus Boni; Calders, Kim; Burt, Andrew			Estimating urban above ground biomass with multi-scale LiDAR	CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT												Background: Urban trees have long been valued for providing ecosystem services (mitigation of the "heat island" effect, suppression of air pollution, etc.); more recently the potential of urban forests to store significant above ground biomass (AGB) has also be recognised. However, urban areas pose particular challenges when assessing AGB due to plasticity of tree form, high species diversity as well as heterogeneous and complex land cover. Remote sensing, in particular light detection and ranging (LiDAR), provide a unique opportunity to assess urban AGB by directly measuring tree structure. In this study, terrestrial LiDAR measurements were used to derive new allometry for the London Borough of Camden, that incorporates the wide range of tree structures typical of an urban setting. Using a wallto-wall airborne LiDAR dataset, individual trees were then identified across the Borough with a new individual tree detection (ITD) method. The new allometry was subsequently applied to the identified trees, generating a Boroughwide estimate of AGB. Results: Camden has an estimated median AGB density of 51.6 Mg ha(-1) where maximum AGB density is found in pockets of woodland; terrestrial LiDAR-derived AGB estimates suggest these areas are comparable to temperate and tropical forest. Multiple linear regression of terrestrial LiDAR-derived maximum height and projected crown area explained 93% of variance in tree volume, highlighting the utility of these metrics to characterise diverse tree structure. Locally derived allometry provided accurate estimates of tree volume whereas a Borough-wide allometry tended to overestimate AGB in woodland areas. The new ITD method successfully identified individual trees; however, AGB was underestimated by <= 25% when compared to terrestrial LiDAR, owing to the inability of ITD to resolve crown overlap. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis identified assigning wood density values as the largest source of uncertainty when estimating AGB. Conclusion: Over the coming century global populations are predicted to become increasingly urbanised, leading to an unprecedented expansion of urban land cover. Urban areas will become more important as carbon sinks and effective tools to assess carbon densities in these areas are therefore required. Using multi-scale LiDAR presents an opportunity to achieve this, providing a spatially explicit map of urban forest structure and AGB.

J	Georgopoulos, N; Gitas, IZ; Korhonen, L; Antoniadis, K; Stefanidou, A				Georgopoulos, Nikos; Gitas, Ioannis Z.; Korhonen, Lauri; Antoniadis, Konstantinos; Stefanidou, Alexandra			Estimating Crown Biomass in a Multilayered Fir Forest Using Airborne LiDAR Data	REMOTE SENSING												The estimation of individual biomass components within tree crowns, such as dead branches (DB), needles (NB), and branch biomass (BB), has received limited attention in the scientific literature despite their significant contribution to forest biomass. This study aimed to assess the potential of multispectral LiDAR data for estimating these biomass components in a multi-layered Abies borissi-regis forest. Destructive (i.e., 13) and non-destructive (i.e., 156) field measurements were collected from Abies borisii-regis trees to develop allometric equations for each crown biomass component and enrich the reference data with the non-destructively sampled trees. A set of machine learning regression algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process (GP), were tested for individual-tree-level DB, NB and BB estimation using LiDAR-derived height and intensity metrics for different spectral channels (i.e., green, NIR and merged) as predictors. The results demonstrated that the RF algorithm achieved the best overall predictive performance for DB (RMSE% = 17.45% and R-2 = 0.89), NB (RMSE% = 17.31% and R-2 = 0.93) and BB (RMSE% = 24.09% and R-2 = 0.85) using the green LiDAR channel. This study showed that the tested algorithms, particularly when utilizing the green channel, accurately estimated the crown biomass components of conifer trees, specifically fir. Overall, LiDAR data can provide accurate estimates of crown biomass in coniferous forests, and further exploration of this method's applicability in diverse forest structures and biomes is warranted.

Estimation of big sagebrush leaf area index with terrestrial laser scanning	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Accurate monitoring and quantification of the structure and function of semiarid ecosystems is necessary to improve carbon and water flux models that help describe how these systems will respond in the future. The leaf area index (LAI, m(2) m(-2)) is an important indicator of energy, water, and carbon exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere. Remote sensing techniques are frequently used to estimate LA!, and can provide users with scalable measurements of vegetation structure and function. We tested terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) techniques to estimate LAI using structural variables such as height, canopy cover, and volume for 42 Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) shrubs across three study sites in the Snake River Plain, Idaho, USA. The TLS-derived variables were regressed against sagebrush LAI estimates calculated using specific leaf area measurements, and compared with point-intercept sampling, a field method of estimating LAI. Canopy cover estimated with the TLS data proved to be a good predictor of LAI (r(2) = 0.73). Similarly, a convex hull approach to estimate volume of the shrubs from the TLS data also strongly predicted LAI (r(2) = 0.76), and compared favorably to point-intercept sampling (r(2) =0.78), a field-based method used in rangelands. These results, coupled with the relative ease-of-use of TLS, suggest that TLS is a promising tool for measuring LAI at the shrub-level. Further work should examine the structural measures in other similar shrublands that are relevant for upscaling LAI to the plot-level (i.e., hectare) using data from TLS and/or airborne laser scanning and to regional levels using satellite-based remote sensing.

Long-term human pressure caused OGFs in Europe to be rare and scattered. Their detailed extent and current status are largely unknown. This review aims to identify potential methods to map temperate old-growth forests (tOGF) by remote sensing (RS) technology, highlights the potentials and benefits, and identifies main knowledge gaps requesting further research. RS offers a wide range of data and methods to map forests and their properties, applicable from local to continental scale. We structured existing mapping approaches in three main groups. First, parameter-based approaches, which are based on forest parameters and usually applied on local to regional scale using detailed data, often from airborne laser scanning (ALS). Second, direct approaches, usually employing machine learning algorithms to generate information from RS data, with high potential for large-area mapping but so far lacking operational applications and related sound accuracy assessment. Finally, indirect approaches integrating various existing data sets to predict OGF existence. These approaches have also been used for large area mapping with a main drawback of missing physical evidence of the identified areas to really hold OGFs as compared to the likelihood of OGF existence. In conclusion, studies dealing with the mapping of OGF using remote sensing are quite limited, but there is a huge amount of knowledge from other forestry-related applications that is yet to be leveraged for OGF identification. We discuss two scenarios, where different data and approaches are suitable, recognizing that one single system cannot serve all potential needs. These may be hot spot identification, detailed area delineation, or status assessment. Further, we pledge for a combined method to overcome the identified limitations of the individual approaches.					; Hirschmugl, Manuela/AEP-0633-2022; Di Filippo, Alfredo/G-1794-2010; Vandekerkhove, Kris/HOF-2191-2023	Hirschmugl, Manuela/0000-0002-5224-0992; Vandekerkhove, Kris/0000-0003-1954-692X													1420-2026	1573-2967				OCT	2023	28	5					761	785		10.1007/s10666-023-09897-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-023-09897-y		MAY 2023											WOS:000990448500001

However, biodiversity and ecosystem services are often inadequately accounted for in land use management decisions. We studied a boreal forest ecosystem by linking citizen-science bird data with detailed information on forest characteristics from airborne laser scanning (ALS). In this paper, we describe this method, and evaluate how similar kinds of biological data sets combined with remote sensing can be used for ecosystem assessments at landscape scale. We analysed data for 41 boreal forest bird species and for 14 structural ALS-based forest parameters. The results support the use of the selected method as a basis for quantifying spatially-explicit biodiversity indicators for ecosystem assessments, while suggestions for improvements are also reported. Finally, we evaluate the capacity of those indicators to describe biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships, for example with carbon trade-offs. The results showed clear distinctions between the different species as measured, for example, by above-ground forest biomass at the observation sites. We also assess how the available data sources can be developed to be compatible with the concept of essential biodiversity variables (EBV), which has been put forward as a solution to cover the most important aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We suggest that EBVs should be integrated into environmental monitoring programmes in the future, and citizen science and remote sensing methods need to be an important part of them.					; Virkkala, Raimo/AAN-6178-2020; Valbuena, Ruben/I-6127-2019; Valbuena, Ruben/K-1249-2014	Vihervaara, Petteri/0000-0002-5889-8402; Valkama, Jari/0000-0002-0393-7320; Valbuena, Ruben/0000-0003-0493-7581; Packalen, Petteri/0000-0003-1804-0011; Bohlin, Inka/0000-0003-1224-6684													0921-2973	1572-9761				MAR	2015	30	3					501	516		10.1007/s10980-014-0137-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-014-0137-5													WOS:000350227000010

Using the GEDI sample data alone, gridded height and biomass products have been created at a spatial resolution of 1 km or coarser. However, this resolution may be too coarse for some applications. In this study, we present a new method of mapping high spatial resolution forest height across large areas using fusion of data acquired by GEDI and TanDEM-X (TDX) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). Our method utilizes GEDI waveforms to provide vertical profiles of scatterers needed to invert a physically-based InSAR model to solve for canopy height. We then use 2-year GEDI canopy height and adaptive wavenumber (kZ)-based calibration models to reduce errors in the inverted canopy height caused by the limited penetration capability of the X-band signal in dense tropical forests and the impact of terrain. We apply this novel method over large areas including Gabon, Mexico, French Guiana and most of the Amazon basin, and generate continuous forest height products at 25 m and 100 m. After validating against airborne lidar data, we find that our canopy height products have a bias of 0.31 m and 0.46 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.48 m (30.02 %) and 6.91 m (24.08 %) at 25 m and 100 m respectively, for all sites combined. Compared to existing data products that integrate GEDI with passive optical data using machine learning approaches, our method reduces bias, has a lower RMSE, and does not saturate for tall canopy heights up to 56 m. A key feature of this study is that our canopy height product is complemented with an uncertainty of prediction map which provides information on the predictor's uncertainty around the actual value -an advancement over the standard error maps used in earlier studies, which provide uncertainty around the expectation of the predicted value. This integration approach enables the first-ever accurate and high-resolution mapping of forest canopy heights at unprecedented large areas from GEDI and TDX InSAR data fusion, serving as an essential foundation for pantropical aboveground biomass mapping.

However, the advantage of hyperspectral drone data has not been tested in a multi-source remote sensing approach (i.e. inclusion of multiple different remote sensing datatypes); and overall, sub-meter-level leaf-area index (LAI) and biomass maps have largely been absent. We evaluated the detectability of LAI and biomass patterns at a northern boreal fen (Halssiaapa) in northern Finland with multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data and assessed the benefit of hyperspectral drone data. We measured vascular plant percentage cover and height as well as moss cover in 140 field plots and connected the structural information to measured aboveground vascular LAI and biomass and moss biomass with linear regressions. We predicted both total and plant functional type (PFT) specific LAI and biomass patterns with random forests regressions with predictors including RGB and hyperspectral drone (28 bands in a spectral range of 500-900 nm), aerial and satellite imagery as well as topography and vegetation height information derived from structure-from-motion drone photogrammetry and aerial lidar data. The modeling performance was between moderate and good for total LAI and biomass (mean explained variance between 49.8 and 66.5%) and variable for PFTs (0.3-61.6%). Hyperspectral data increased model performance in most of the regressions, usually relatively little, but in some of the regressions, the inclusion of hyperspectral data even decreased model performance (change in mean explained variance between -14.5 and 9.1%-points). The most important features in regressions included drone topography, vegetation height, hyperspectral and RGB features. The spatial patterns and landscape estimates of LAI and biomass were quite similar in regressions with or without hyperspectral data, in particular for moss and total biomass. The results suggest that the fine-scale spatial patterns of peatland LAI and biomass can be detected with multi-source remote sensing data, vegetation mapping should include both spectral and topographic predictors at sub-meter-level spatial resolution and that hyperspectral imagery gives only slight benefits.

L.; Vorster, Anthony; Anderson, Ryan; Evangelista, Paul			Developing nondestructive species-specific tree allometry with terrestrial laser scanning	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Allometric equations predict organism attributes from simple measurements and underlie many global-scale estimates, from plant productivity to ecosystem carbon stocks. In forests, destructive harvesting of trees in common groups (e.g. plant functional type) or at the species level is necessary to develop allometry but, since sampling is extremely difficult, predictions from these equations have high uncertainty due to low sample size, spatial bias and unrepresentative sampling of tree size. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a promising remote sensing technology that enables efficient and nondestructive estimates of tree-level structure for developing allometric equations. 2. Here, we nondestructively estimated component biomass of three coniferous tree species (Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta and Pseudotsuga menziesii) in Colorado, USA using TLS. We evaluated the suitability for this nondestructive data to be supplanted for destructive data in the development of species-specific allometric equations and compared the prediction accuracy against a commonly used national-scale allometry. 3. We found TLS biomass estimates were consistently more precise across species (RMSE = similar to 19%) than nation-scale allometry (RMSE = similar to 39%). Nondestructive biomass estimates from TLS are a suitable addition to or replacement for traditional sampling methods, with indistinguishable biomass predictions across most of the tested diameter range. We further show how TLS can be used to develop allometric equations compatible with airborne LiDAR and other remote sensing variables (e.g. height and crown area), developing generalized biomass predictions from crown area and tree height (R-2 = 0.87). 4. The ability for TLS to support the development of nondestructive allometry at a global scale will enable a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of individual tree architecture, while supporting the next generation of biomass remote sensing.					; Stovall, Atticus/AAP-1388-2021	Anderson, Ryan/0000-0002-2821-3302; Stovall, Atticus/0000-0001-9512-3318; 													2041-210X	2041-2096				JAN	2023	14	1					280	290		10.1111/2041-210X.14027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14027		NOV 2022											WOS:000884104700001

Advances in Laser Scanning to Assess Carbon in Forests: From Ground-Based to Space-Based Sensors	CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS												Purpose of ReviewQuantifying the store and flux of carbon across space and time from trees to forest stands, and ultimately at a global scale, has become paramount for a broad range of applications, including individual tree based allometry, landscape scale forest carbon accounting as well as derivation of globally required climate change related variables. Despite this significant information need, the measurement of forest carbon using field methods remains laborious, expensive and logistically complex.Recent FindingsLaser scanning technologies mounted on terrestrial, unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, aircraft or satellites have revolutionised the estimation of forest carbon at a variety of spatial and temporal scales with each providing detailed and often unique information about the distribution of biomass and carbon within a stand. In this review, we examined the use of laser scanning technologies for this purpose. SummaryTo do so we focus on the recently published (within 10 years) peer reviewed literature and consider studies across four information needs, individual tree, stand, regional / national, and global scales. We consider the type of laser scanning data that is typically acquired, data processing pipelines and the products that are produced. After reviewing these studies, we conclude with a discussion of remaining issues associated with the mapping of forest carbon using laser scanning technologies. We also highlight a number of future research directions to further expand the use of this technology for forest carbon mapping globally.					; Irwin, Liam/LBI-7005-2024; Coops, Nicholas/J-1543-2012	Irwin, Liam/0000-0001-8582-6490; 													2198-6436					JAN 22	2025	11	1							11	10.1007/s40725-024-00242-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40725-024-00242-4													WOS:001402121200001

High spatial resolution three-dimensional mapping of vegetation spectral dynamics using computer vision	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												High spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) measurements of vegetation by remote sensing are advancing ecological research and environmental management However, substantial economic and logistical costs limit this application, especially for observing phenological dynamics in ecosystem structure and spectral traits. Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This "Ecosynth" methodology applies photogrammetric "Structure from Motion" computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (<130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (<USD$4000), lightweight (<2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30-67 points M-2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 625 ha (250 m x 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2-4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4-12 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R-2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31-36% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m x 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology. Inexpensive user-deployed technologies for multispectral 3D scanning of vegetation at landscape scales (<1 km(2)) heralds a new era of participatory remote sensing by field ecologists, community foresters and the interested public.

Importance of sample size, data type and prediction method for remote sensing-based estimations of aboveground forest biomass	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimates of forest biomass are needed for various technical and scientific applications, ranging from carbon and bioenergy policies to sustainable forest management. As local measurements are costly, there is a great interest in obtaining reliable estimates over large areas from remote sensing data. Currently, such estimates are obtained with a variety of data sources, statistical methods and prediction standards, and there is no agreement on what are best practices for this task. To improve our understanding of how these different methods affect prediction quality, we first conducted a systematic review of the available literature to identify the most common sensor types and prediction methods. Based on the review, we identified sample size of the reference points on the ground, prediction method (step-wise linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, Gaussian processes and k-nearest neighbor), and sensor type as the main differences that could potentially affect predictive quality. We then compared those factors in two case study areas in Germany and Chile, for which airborne discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and airborne hyperspectral as well as airborne discrete return LiDAR and spaceborne hyperspectral data were available. For each factor combination, we calculated Pearson's coefficient of correlation between observations and predictions (r(2)) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for bootstrapped estimates using k-fold cross-validation with a varying number of folds. Finally, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to quantify the influence of the factors on the predictive error of the biomass models. Our results confirm previous findings that predictor data (sensor) type is the most important factor for the accuracy of biomass estimates, with LiDAR being preferable to hyperspectral data. In contrast to some previous studies, complementing LiDAR with hyperspectral data did not improve predictive accuracy. Also the prediction method had a substantial effect on accuracy and was generally more important than the sample size. In most cases, random forest performed best and stepwise linear models worst, judging from r(2) and RMSE under cross-validation. Additional results suggested that r(2) may deliver unrealistically large values when the hold-out sample during the cross-validation is too small. In conclusion, our literature review revealed that different methods for biomass estimation are currently used, with no general agreement on best practices. In our case studies, we found substantial accuracy differences between those methods, with LiDAR data, in combination with a random forest algorithm and a large number of reference sample units on the ground yielding the lowest error for biomass predictions. The comparatively high importance of the statistical prediction method seems particularly relevant, as they suggest that choosing the appropriate statistical method may be more effective than obtaining additional field data for obtaining good biomass estimates. Considering the costs of improving accuracy of global and regional biomass estimates by ground measurements, it seems sensible to invest in further comparative studies, preferably with a wider range of sites and including also RADAR sensors, to establish robust best-practice recommendations for obtaining regional and global biomass estimates from remote-sensing data.

J	Marrs, J; Ni-Meister, W				Marrs, Julia; Ni-Meister, Wenge			Machine Learning Techniques for Tree Species Classification Using Co-Registered LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data	REMOTE SENSING												The use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques for recording and analyzing tree and forest structural variables shows strong promise for improving established hyperspectral-based tree species classifications; however, previous multi-sensoral projects were often limited by error resulting from seasonal or flight path differences. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard's LiDAR, hyperspectral, and thermal imager (G-LiHT) is now providing co-registered data on experimental forests in the United States, which are associated with established ground truths from existing forest plots. Free, user-friendly machine learning applications like the Orange Data Mining Extension for Python recently simplified the process of combining datasets, handling variable redundancy and noise, and reducing dimensionality in remotely sensed datasets. Neural networks, CN2 rules, and support vector machine methods are used here to achieve a final classification accuracy of 67% for dominant tree species in experimental plots of Howland Experimental Forest, a mixed coniferous-deciduous forest with ten dominant tree species, and 59% for plots in Penobscot Experimental Forest, a mixed coniferous-deciduous forest with 15 dominant tree species. These accuracies are higher than those produced using LiDAR or hyperspectral datasets separately, suggesting that combined spectral and structural data have a greater richness of complementary information than either dataset alone. Using greatly simplified datasets created by our dimensionality reduction methodology, machine learner performance remains comparable or higher to that using the full dataset. Across forests, the identification of shared structural and spectral variables suggests that this methodology can successfully identify parameters with high explanatory power for differentiating among tree species, and opens the possibility of addressing large-scale forestry questions using optimized remote sensing workflows.

Accurate carbon density estimation is the basis for studying the response mechanisms of forest ecosystems to global climate change. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology can acquire the vertical structure parameters of forests with a higher precision and penetration ability than traditional optical remote sensing. Combining top of canopy height model (TCH) and allometry models, this paper constructed two prediction models of aboveground carbon density (ACD) with 94 square plots in northwestern China: one model is plot-averaged height-based power model and the other is plot-averaged daisy-chain model. The correlation coefficients (R-2) were 0.6725 and 0.6761, which are significantly higher than the correlation coefficients of the traditional percentile model (R-2 = 0.5910). In addition, the correlation between TCH and ACD was significantly better than that between plot-averaged height (AvgH) and ACD, and Lorey's height (LorH) had no significant correlation with ACD. We also found that plot-level basal area (BA) was a dominant factor in ACD prediction, with a correlation coefficient reaching 0.9182, but this subject requires field investigation. The two models proposed in this study provide a simple and easy approach for estimating ACD in coniferous forests, which can replace the traditional LiDAR percentile method completely.																			1664-462X					JUL 10	2019	10								917	10.3389/fpls.2019.00917	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00917								31354780					WOS:000474712000001

Up to now, radar remote sensing was hardly possible in the treeline zone due to spatial resolution and/or temporal decorrelation constraints of preceding satellite missions. The unique constellation of the TanDEM-X satellites with its bistatic mode and very high spatial resolution opens up opportunities for monitoring small (>= 0.01 km(2)) and isolated patches of very sparse forest which are typical for the transitional zone. We focused on an area at the northern edge of the treeline zone in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and evaluated the potential of TanDEM-X bistatic data to characterize the tree height in the forest patches in this region. TanDEM-X data were acquired during the TanDEM-X Science Phase in 2015, when the perpendicular baseline was large (corresponding to the height of ambiguity of approximately 14.6 m) and kept constant. We employed TanDEM-X backscatter, bistatic coherence, and interferometric height from the stack of seven multitemporal bistatic pairs and compared them to maximum vegetation height obtained from full-waveform airborne LiDAR data. We found strong linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and LiDAR vegetation height within the forest patches with r = 0.67, r = -0.69, and r = 0.78 for the backscatter, coherence, and interferometric height, respectively. Furthermore, we extracted the position of individual trees from the LiDAR data and estimated tree density as the number of trees per unit area. The linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and the tree density were very weak. The relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and tree height differentiated for three tree density classes (low, medium, and high) remained strong. Random forests regression using all three TanDEM-X metrics predicted the tree height with a mean absolute error of 0.7 m (mean forest height in the study area was 2.5 m). CoSSC pairs were generally consistent with each other and the multitemporal averaging slightly improved the performance compared to single pairs. Taking into account the global coverage of bistatic TanDEM-X data acquired for the global digital elevation model, our results show a potential for quantifying the tree height in small forest patches along the circum-Arctic treeline zone.					; Höfle, Bernhard/A-4702-2010; Anders, Katharina/ADR-7694-2022; Boike, Julia/R-4766-2016; Thiel, Christian/AAU-8029-2021; Boike, Julia/JZT-8129-2024	Antonova, Sofia/0000-0002-5310-786X; Höfle, Bernhard/0000-0001-5849-1461; Anders, Katharina/0000-0001-5698-7041; Boike, Julia/0000-0002-5875-2112; Zwieback, Simon/0000-0002-1398-6046; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				SEP 15	2019	231								111251	10.1016/j.rse.2019.111251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111251													WOS:000484643900031
J	Moran, CJ; Kane, VR; Seielstad, CA				Moran, Christopher J.; Kane, Van R.; Seielstad, Carl A.			Mapping Forest Canopy Fuels in the Western United States with LiDAR-Landsat Covariance	REMOTE SENSING												Comprehensive spatial coverage of forest canopy fuels is relied upon by fire management in the US to predict fire behavior, assess risk, and plan forest treatments. Here, a collection of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets from the western US are fused with Landsat-derived spectral indices to map the canopy fuel attributes needed for wildfire predictions: canopy cover (CC), canopy height (CH), canopy base height (CBH), and canopy bulk density (CBD). A single, gradient boosting machine (GBM) model using data from all landscapes is able to characterize these relationships with only small reductions in model performance (mean 0.04 reduction in R-2) compared to local GBM models trained on individual landscapes. Model evaluations on independent LiDAR datasets show the single global model outperforming local models (mean 0.24 increase in R-2), indicating improved model generality. The global GBM model significantly improves performance over existing LANDFIRE canopy fuels data products (R-2 ranging from 0.15 to 0.61 vs. -3.94 to -0.374). The ability to automatically update canopy fuels following wildfire disturbance is also evaluated, and results show intuitive reductions in canopy fuels for high and moderate fire severity classes and little to no change for unburned to low fire severity classes. Improved canopy fuel mapping and the ability to apply the same predictive model on an annual basis enhances forest, fuel, and fire management.

Over the last few decades, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven to be a useful tool for accurate carbon stock and biomass estimation in various biomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of multispectral LiDAR data for the reliable estimation of single-tree total and barkless stem biomass (TSB and BSB) in an uneven-aged structured forest with complex topography. Destructive and non-destructive field measurements were collected for a total of 67 dominant and co-dominant Abies borisii-regis trees located in a mountainous area in Greece. Subsequently, two allometric equations were constructed to enrich the reference data with non-destructively sampled trees. Five different regression algorithms were tested for single-tree BSB and TSB estimation using height (height percentiles and bicentiles, max and average height) and intensity (skewness, standard deviation and average intensity) LiDAR-derived metrics: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Gaussian Process (GP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results showcased that the RF algorithm provided the best overall predictive performance in both BSB (i.e., RMSE = 175.76 kg and R-2 = 0.78) and TSB (i.e., RMSE = 211.16 kg and R-2 = 0.65) cases. Our work demonstrates that BSB can be estimated with moderate to high accuracy using all the tested algorithms, contrary to the TSB, where only three algorithms (RF, SVR and GP) can adequately provide accurate TSB predictions due to bark irregularities along the stems. Overall, the multispectral LiDAR data provide accurate stem biomass estimates, the general applicability of which should be further tested in different biomes and ecosystems.					; Georgopoulos, Nikos/JCN-8909-2023; Stavrakoudis, Dimitris/F-9730-2017; Gitas, Ioannis/C-3329-2008; Korhonen, Lauri/H-4179-2019	Stavrakoudis, Dimitris/0000-0001-9370-5058; Georgopoulos, Nikos/0000-0002-4734-253X; Korhonen, Lauri/0000-0002-9352-0114														2072-4292				DEC	2021	13	23							4827	10.3390/rs13234827	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13234827													WOS:000734578800001
J	Cheng, F; Yang, RJ; Wu, JE				Cheng, Feng; Yang, Ruijiao; Wu, Junen			Integrating Active and Passive Remote Sensing Data for Forest Age Estimation in Shangri-La City, China	FORESTS												The accurate mapping of age structure and access to spatially explicit information are essential to optimal planning and policy-making for forest ecosystems, including forest management and sustainable economic development. Specifically, surveying and mapping the age structure of forests is crucial for calculating the carbon sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems. However, spatial heterogeneity and limited accessibility make forest age mapping in mountainous areas challenging. Here, we present a new workflow using ICESat-2 LiDAR data integrated with multisource remote sensing imagery to estimate forest age in Shangri-La, China. Two methods-a climate-driven exponential model and a random forest algorithm-are compared to infer the age structure of the five dominant species in Shangri-La. The climate-driven model, with an R2 of 0.67 and an RMSE of 12.79 years, outperforms the random forest model. The derived wall-to-wall forest age map at 30 m resolution reveals that nearly all forests in Shangri-La are mature or overmature, especially among the high-elevation species Abies fabri (Mast.) Craib and Picea asperata Mast., compared with Pinus yunnanensis Franch., Quercus aquifolioides Rehd. and E.H. Wils. and Pinus densata Mast., where the age structure is more evenly distributed across different elevation ranges. Younger forests are frequently found around human settlements and along the Jinsha River valley, whereas older forests are located in remote and high-elevation areas that are less disturbed. The combined use of active and passive remote sensing data has resulted in substantial improvements in the spatial detail and accuracy of wall-to-wall age mapping, which is expected to be a cost-effective approach for supporting forest management and carbon accounting in this important ecological region. The method developed here can be scaled to other mountain areas both to understand the age patterns and structure of mountain forests and to provide critical information for forestation, reforestation and carbon accounting in surface-to-high mountain areas, which are increasingly crucial for climate mitigation.					; Wu, Junen/IST-4205-2023	Wu, Junen/0000-0002-5240-2314; 														1999-4907				SEP	2024	15	9							1622	10.3390/f15091622	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f15091622													WOS:001322878200001

Estimating Biophysical Parameters of Individual Trees in an Urban Environment Using Small Footprint Discrete-Return Imaging Lidar	REMOTE SENSING												Quantification of biophysical parameters of urban trees is important for urban planning, and for assessing carbon sequestration and ecosystem services. Airborne lidar has been used extensively in recent years to estimate biophysical parameters of trees in forested ecosystems. However, similar studies are largely lacking for individual trees in urban landscapes. Prediction models to estimate biophysical parameters such as height, crown area, diameter at breast height, and biomass for over two thousand individual trees were developed using best subsets multiple linear regression for a study area in central Oklahoma, USA using point cloud distributional metrics from an Optech ALTM 2050 lidar system. A high level of accuracy was attained for estimating individual tree height (R-2 = 0.89), dbh (R-2 = 0.82), crown diameter (R-2 = 0.90), and biomass (R-2 = 0.67) using lidar-based metrics for pooled data of all tree species. More variance was explained in species-specific estimates of biomass (R-2 = 0.68 for Juniperus virginiana to 0.84 for Ulmus parviflora) than in estimates from broadleaf deciduous (R-2 = 0.63) and coniferous (R-2 = 0.45) taxonomic groups-or the data set analysed as a whole (R-2 = 0.67). The metric crown area performed particularly well for most of the species-specific biomass equations, which suggests that tree crowns should be delineated accurately, whether manually or using automatic individual tree detection algorithms, to obtain a good estimation of biomass using lidar-based metrics.					; Shrestha, Rupesh/I-1641-2016; Wynne, Randolph/A-8966-2009	Wynne, Randolph/0000-0003-3649-835X; Shrestha, Rupesh/0000-0002-3140-6623; 														2072-4292				FEB	2012	4	2					484	508		10.3390/rs4020484	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs4020484													WOS:000306756400008

The use of waveform lidar to measure northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest structure in New Hampshire	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The direct retrieval of canopy height and the estimation of aboveground biomass are two important measures of forest structure that can be quantified by airborne laser scanning at landscape scales. These and other metrics are central to studies attempting to quantify global carbon cycles and to improve understanding of the spatial variation in forest structure evident within differing biomes. Data acquired using NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) over the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) was used to assess the performance of waveform lidar in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest. Using coincident plots established for this study, we found strong agreement between field and lidar measurements of height (r(2)=0.80, 2 p < 0.000) at the footprint level. Allometric calculations of aboveground biomass (AGBM) and LVIS metrics (AGBM: r(2)=0.61, PRESS RMSE=58.0 Mg ha(-1), p < 0.000) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) and LVIS metrics (r(2) = 0.54, p = 0.002) also showed good agreement at the footprint level. Application of a generalized equation for determining AGBM proposed by Lefsky et a]. (2002a) to footprint-level field data from Bartlett resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.55; RMSE = 64.4 Mg ha(-1); p 0.002. This is slightly weaker than the strongest relationship found with the best-fit single term regression model. Relationships between a permanent grid of USDA Forest Service inventory plots and the mean values of aggregated LVIS metrics, however, were not as strong. This discrepancy suggests that validation efforts must be cautious in using pre-existing field data networks as a sole means of calibrating and verifying such remote sensing data. Stratification based on land-use or species composition, however, did provide the means to improve regression relationships at this scale. Regression models established at the footprint level for AGBM and QMSD were applied to LVIS data to generate predicted values for the whole of Bartlett. The accuracy of these models was assessed using varying subsets of the USFS NERS plot data. Coefficient of determinations ranged from fair to strong with aspects of land-use history and species composition influencing both the fit and the level of error seen in the predicted relationships.

Fine-scale three-dimensional modeling of boreal forest plots to improve forest characterization with remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Improving the quality of information that can be obtained from forest inventories can enhance planning for the best use of forest resources. In this study, we demonstrate the capability to improve the characterization of forest inventory attributes using terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data, a fine-scale architectural model (L-Architect), and airborne laser scanner (ALS) data. Terrestrial laser scanning provides detailed and accurate three-dimensional data and has the potential to characterize forest plots with comprehensive structural information. We use TLS data and in situ measurements as input to L-Architect to create reference plots. The use of L-Architect for modeling was validated by comparing selected attributes of the reference plots with validation plots produced using simulated TLS data, with normalized root-mean square error (NMRSE) values below 17%. Surrogate plots were then created using a library of tree models where individual trees were selected according to three attributes tree height, diameter at breast height, and crown projected area either measured from in situ plots or derived from ALS data. The accuracy of the surrogate plots was assessed by comparing several key forest attributes from the reference plots, including branching structure (e.g., number of whorls, knot surface), crown shape and size (e.g., base height, asymmetry), heterogeneity (e.g., lacunarity, fractal dimension), tree volume, and the spatial distribution of material (e.g., Weibull fit, leaf area index). Overall, the surrogate plots reproduced the attributes of the reference plots with NRMSE mean value of 17% (R-2 = 0.68) using in situ ground measurements and 24% (R-2 = 0.51) using inputs estimated with ALS. Some attributes, such as leaf area index, knot surface, and fractal dimension, were well predicted (R-2 > 0.80), whereas others, like crown asymmetry and lacunarity, had weak correspondence (R-2 < 0.16). The ability to create surrogate forest plots with L-Architect makes it possible to estimate detailed structural attributes that are difficult to measure with conventional forest mensuration techniques and that can be used for model calibration with above-canopy remote-sensing data sets.

It is understood that REDD mechanisms must be supported by forest assessment programs that can monitor the carbon stocks by carbon pools and human activities. Reporting at a national level will be required but many countries are likely to benefit from more local monitoring programs within the countries as well, gauging the effects of national policies and local financial mechanisms aimed at reaching goals for emission control for the nation as a whole. Field-based forest sample surveys are typically used as support for national reporting purposes. However, monitoring within the countries will require huge investments in field surveys to provide reliable change estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution. Airborne scanning LiDAR has emerged as a promising tool to provide auxiliary data for sample surveys aiming at estimation of above-ground tree biomass. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how "wall-to-wall" LiDAR data can be used for change estimation. Estimators for areal changes of categories representing human activities such as "deforestation", "degradation" and "untouched" were presented. Corresponding estimators for variance were also provided. Furthermore, it was shown how net change in biomass for the defined activity categories and for the entire area of interest can be estimated from a field sample survey with and without support of LiDAR remote sensing data and how the uncertainty can be quantified by corresponding variance estimates. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6 ha) a probability sample of 176 field sample plots distributed according to a stratified systematic design was measured twice over an 11 year period. Corresponding multi-temporal scanning LiDAR data were also available. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to predict change category for every LiDAR grid cell in the area, and areal changes were estimated from the pure field sample and with the support of the LiDAR data applying model-assisted estimators. The standard errors of the areal change estimates were reduced by 43-75% by adding LiDAR data to the estimation. The change categories were used as post-strata in a subsequent estimation of net change in biomass. The standard errors of the biomass change estimates for the respective change categories were reduced by 18-84% compared to the pure field survey when using LiDAR data as auxiliary information in a model-assisted estimation procedure, which translates to a need for 1.5-38.7 times as many field plots when relying only on the field data. For the entire area of interest, the standard error of the overall net change in biomass was reduced by 57% compared to the uncertainty reported from the pure field survey. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is quite costly and time-consuming, particularly for larger areas. Recently, significant developments have been made in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology to improve the cost and time efficiency in forest inventory. Therefore, UAV images have become one of the inventory tools that produces data with high spatial resolution in determining forest resources. This study aims to investigate the contribution of UAV data to forest inventory in a case study area with a total of 30 sample plots located in pure and natural Crimean pine (Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold ssp. pallasiana (Lamb.) Holmboe) stands in the Black Sea backward region of T & uuml;rkiye. Total tree height (h) and stem volume (v) were recorded at individual tree level (n = 367), and the number of trees (N), mean height (h(mean)), top height (h(top)), stand basal area (BA) and stand volume (V) were calculated at sample plot level (n = 30) from both the field and UAV-based data. Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) for h and v were 0.96 and 0.72, respectively, the highest correlation at the sample plot level was observed for the h(mean) - h(top) (r = 0.96), while the lowest correlation was found for BA (r = 0.54). The suitability of the observation and prediction values was assessed using a t-test at both individual tree and sample plot levels. According to the t-test results, the observation and prediction values for h, v, h(mean), h(top), BA and V metrics were found to be compatible (p > 0.05), but not for N (p < 0.05). Overall results indicated that UAV technology has a potential to be used in forest inventory and can contribute to the determination of individual tree and stand metrics. Thereby, it saves cost and time in forest inventory studies and helps monitoring the dynamic structure of the forest ecosystem with an effective approach in forest inventory.					aksoy, hasan/AAI-6557-2021; Bulut, Sinan/ADY-3076-2022; Bolat, Ferhat/HHD-1637-2022	Aksoy, Hasan/0000-0003-1980-3834													0143-1161	1366-5901				JUN 17	2024	45	12					3872	3896		10.1080/01431161.2024.2357837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2024.2357837													WOS:001238832800001

Mainly, satellite optical vegetation indices and LiDAR data have been used to this purpose. These two techniques are limited by cloud cover and are sensitive only to the top of vegetation. In addition, the vegetation attenuation to the soil microwave emission, represented by the vegetation optical depth (VOD), has been applied for biomass estimation using frequencies ranging from 4 to 30 GHz (C- to K-bands). Atmosphere is transparent to microwaves and their sensitivity to canopy layers depends on the frequency, with lower frequencies having greater penetration depths. In this regard, L-band VOD (1.4 GHz) is expected to enhance the ability to estimate carbon stocks. This study compares the sensitivity of different VOD products (from L, C, and X-bands) and an optical vegetation index (EVI) to the above-ground carbon density (ACD). It quantifies the contribution of ACD and forest cover proportion to the VOD/EVI signals. The study is conducted in Peru, southern Colombia and Panama, where ACD maps have been derived from airborne LiDAR. Results confirm the enhanced sensitivity of L-band VOD to ACD when compared to higher frequency bands, and show that the sensitivity of all VOD bands decreases in the densest forests. ACD explains 34% and forest cover 30% of L-band VOD variance, and these proportions gradually decrease for EVI, C-, and X-band VOD, respectively. Results are consistent through different categories of altitude and carbon density. This pattern is found in most of the studied regions and in flooded forests. Results also show that C-, X-band VOD and EVI provide complementary information to L-band VOD, especially in flooded forests and in mountains, indicating that synergistic approaches could lead to improved retrievals in these regions. Although the assessment of vegetation carbon in the densest forests requires further research, results from this study support the use of new L-band VOD estimates for mapping the carbon of tropical forests.

However, to date there has been little effort to develop a set of protocols for data acquisition and processing that would move governments or the forest industry towards cost-effective implementation of this technology for strategic and tactical (i.e., operational) forest resource inventories. The goal of this paper is to initiate this process by examining the significance of LiDAR data acquisition (i.e., point density) for modeling forest inventory variables for the range of species and stand conditions representing much of Ontario, Canada. Field data for approximately 200 plots, sampling a broad range of forest types and conditions across Ontario, were collected for three study sites. Airborne LiDAR data, characterized by a mean density of 3.2 pulses m(-2) were systematically decimated to produce additional datasets with densities of approximately 1.6 and 0.5 pulses m-2. Stepwise regression models, incorporating LiDAR height and density metrics, were developed for each of the three LiDAR datasets across a range of forest types to estimate the following forest inventory variables: (1) average height (R-2(adj) = 0.75-0.95); (2) top height (R-2(adj) = 0.74-0.98); (3) quadratic mean diameter (R-2(adj) = 0.55-0.85); (4) basal area (R-2(adj) = 0.22-0.93); (5) gross total volume (R-2(adj) = 0.42-0.94); (6) gross merchantable volume (R-2(adj) = 0.35-0.93); (7) total aboveground biomass (R-2(adj) = 0.23-0.93); and (8) stem density (R-2(adj) = 0.17-0.86). Aside from a few cases (i.e., average height and density for some stand types), no decimation effect was observed with respect to the precision of the prediction of the majority of forest variables, which suggests that a mean density of 0.5 pulses m(-2) is sufficient for plot and stand level modeling under these diverse forest conditions across Ontario.

J	Nazir, A; Hanan, NP; Yu, QY; Gilani, H				Nazir, Abid; Hanan, Niall P.; Yu, Qiuyan; Gilani, Hammad			Enhancing GEDI above ground biomass density estimates in contrasting forests of Pakistan	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Forests are considered a critical resource for climate change mitigation because they capture and store carbon dioxide in forest biomass. Large-scale assessments of forest biomass have benefited recently from the increasing availability of ground-based forest inventory data and detailed vegetation structural data from airborne and terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR). However, both terrestrial and airborne LiDAR data are costly, and not feasible for many nations. In contrast, since 2019, the spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) laser instrument has collected publicly available data for global temperate and tropical forests. GEDI waveforms in conjunction with models calibrated using a worldwide network of field data to produce biomass products. However, relatively few field plots are available in the forests of South Asia in GEDI's current calibration dataset. We show here that GEDI's statistical estimators of Above Ground Biomass Density (AGBD) can be enhanced using local models calibrated strategically with GEDI data and field plots (594) in two contrasting forest ecosystems (i.e., mountain forests with evergreen broadleaf and needle-leaf trees, and coastal mangroves) in Pakistan. On-orbit GEDI AGBD estimations in mountainous areas have an RMSE of 95 Mg/ha / 87 % whereas estimates in mangrove areas have an RMSE of 8.4 Mg/ha / 89 %. GEDI AGBD estimates in mountain regions consistently underestimate field measurements in regions with higher AGBD (>300 Mg/ha), and overestimate in regions with low AGBD (<50 Mg/ha). In contrast, the locally recalibrated biomass models using the field measured data return RMSE of 39.6 Mg/ha / 36 % in mountain regions and 4.1 Mg/ha / 39 % in mangroves. GEDI is a valuable auxiliary resource for AGBD estimates in the absence of updated NFI measurements or over jurisdictions lacking enough reference data. However, local calibration using field data can increase accuracy and precision, particularly in areas where the base models have sparse local calibration data. Improved estimates from GEDI could then be used with active and passive satellite data for regional AGBD mapping and to lower uncertainties in regions with low NFI sampling coverage.					; Nazir, Abid/OKR-9567-2025; Gilani, Hammad/AGF-7853-2022	Hanan, Niall/0000-0002-9130-5306; Nazir, Abid/0000-0003-4702-423X; Gilani, Hammad/0000-0002-9439-640X; 													0378-1127	1872-7042				JUL 1	2025	587								122747	10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122747		APR 2025											WOS:001482027200001
J	Narine, L; Malambo, L; Popescu, S				Narine, Lana; Malambo, Lonesome; Popescu, Sorin			Characterizing canopy cover with ICESat-2: A case study of southern forests in Texas and Alabama, USA	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The acquisition of elevation measurements from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and availability of airborne lidar data over the US present an exceptional opportunity to understand vegetation structural estimates provided by ICESat-2. Although a critical forest biophysical attribute, canopy cover is not yet reported from ICESat-2. Thus, there is a need to better understand the application of ICESat-2 for providing canopy cover information. The overall goal of this study was to investigate methods to derive canopy cover and characterize the predictive capability, with ICESat-2. Given availability of dedicated vegetation products (ATL08) and custom noise filtering algorithms developed for ICESat-2 photon data, multiple datasets were evaluated in this study. With focus on two study sites, the Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in south-east Texas and the Solon Dixon Forestry Education Center (SDFEC) in southern Alabama, specific objectives were to: (1) Evaluate equations for estimating canopy cover using custom-processed geolocated photon data, ATL03, and ICESat-2's vegetation product data, ATL08, (2) Compare ICESat-2-derived estimates of canopy cover with airborne lidar canopy cover, and (3) Evaluate a modeling-based approach to improve predictions of canopy cover by leveraging available canopy metrics from ATL08 and custom-processed datasets. A total of six (6) potential measures of canopy cover were investigated in this study, based on 100-m ATL08 segments: (i) percentage of photons above 2 m, (ii) percentage of photons above 4.6 m, (iii) percent of canopy (inside canopy) and top-of -canopy photons of total canopy and ground photons, (iv) percent of canopy of total ground and canopy photons, (v) percent of top-of-canopy of total top-of-canopy and ground photons, and (vi) mean of (iii), (iv) and (v). While strongest correlations were produced from canopy cover computed with (ii) (r between 0.72 and 0.84), similar relationships were indicated from using (iii) and (v) (r values between 0.70 and 0.79). Considering a suite of available canopy parameters, the best R2 and RMSE values from canopy cover estimation models were produced from the use of custom-processed ICESat-2-derived metrics (R2 and RMSE values of 0.77 and 13%). Findings from this study highlight methods for estimating canopy cover with ICESat-2 that may be suitable to a range of cover types, in addition to vegetation settings where cut-offs based on tree heights (e.g., 2 m and 4.6 m) are not applicable. With multiple approaches to characterizing canopy cover, results serve to better understand the applicability of ICESat-2 as a data source for canopy cover information and ultimately inform ongoing efforts for deriving an updated gridded product.
